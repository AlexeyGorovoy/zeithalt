## 11. Battle Rewards

`ðŸ“‘ Term`

Participating in battles yields rewards both in gold and increased [charged bonuses](../discord_battle_rules/rules_04_charged_hits.md) for the next battle.

The gold reward is simply your hits in the battle times 10: **11 hits = 110G**.

Based on your involvement, you're assigned a title that gives you higher charged bonus in the following battle:
- [B] **Best** - **7 pts** - awarded to players with the highest hits;
- [T] **Top** - **5 pts** - awarded to players who were best in their faction;
- [E] **Elite** - **3pts**- all other players in top 10;
- [V] **Veteran** - **2pts** - all other players with 5+ hits.

If the best player in a faction is already the best warrior overall, this role is awarded to the second-best player in faction.

If more than one player eligible for the role - they all get it.

For example, if in a battle both **T95** and **Eldar** did 21 hits (more than anyone else), then in the next battle they both will have 7pts bonus.

To be eligible for any of the titles, the minimum of 5 hits is required.  
A player cannot be a Top or Elite Warrior without meeting the requirement for Veteran Warrior.
