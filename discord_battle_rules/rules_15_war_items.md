## 15. WAR Items

`ðŸ“‘ Battle Rules`

There are three types of items - Weapons, Armor and Relics (WAR for short), all items are unique but items of the same type give the same bonus.

> **Weapon**  
> Basic: +1pt damage  
> Epic: +2pts damage
>
> _T95 attacks with ðŸ‘Š **Persuasive Knuckles**! +1pt damage!_
>
> Weapons are the most powerful of WAR items - it makes your hits twice as effective, dealin 2pts of damage instead of 1pt.
>
> Yes, this includes the damage done in combos.

> **Armor**  
> Basic: +1pt charge  
> Epic: +3pt charge
>
> _Muslim gets +1pt charge from ðŸ§£ **Scarf of Unsolicited Coziness**_
>
> Armor gives you a +1pt bonus to your charge,  but only if you're already charged.

> **Relic**  
> Basic: +5m charged time  
> Epic: +10m charged time
>
> _Bubaleh gets +5m charged time from ðŸŽ² **Pseudorandom Dice**_
>
> These items reduce your cooldowns and increase your charged time, to give you more flexibility in syncing with other people.

You can only get these benefits from one of each WAR items, so the best "build" is just having 1  epic weapon + 1 epic armor + 1 epic relic in your inventory.

As we learned in the recent battle, sharing items with others can increase the faction's strength, and gives room for cooperation.

**_All 60 items were randomly distributed to players, at this moment there are no plans to add more items._**
