## 12. Using Power Ups

`ðŸ“‘ Battle Rules`

**Power-ups** are "paid" bonuses in battles, you use your own gold and pay to win, easy.

Three bot commands are available during the battles:

> **/influence, cost: 20G, +10pts** - This command checks if you **won** at least one Influence game since your previous hit, if so - deals 10 damage.
>
> **How to use:** do at least 1 hit in battle, go play Influence, get back in [battle channel](https://discord.com/channels/562910943848169472/995641432742297731) and do /influence command.

> **/duel, cost 30G, +10pts** - This command checks if you **played** at least one Influence Duel since your previous hit, if so - deal 10 damage.
>
> **How to use:** do at least 1 hit in battle, go play Influence Duels, get back in [battle channel](https://discord.com/channels/562910943848169472/995641432742297731) and use /duel command. You don't have to win this duel, but both players need to have finished at least one turn.

> **/pay-to-win, cost 100G, +10pts** - This command just deals 10 damage.
>
> **How to use:** pure pay to win.

*Power-ups are separate from [combos](../discord_battle_rules/rules_03_general_gameplay.md) and have no effect on them.*
*Every player can use each power-up only once per battle.*
