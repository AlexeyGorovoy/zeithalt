## 7. Key Members and Official Actions

`ðŸ“‘ Battle Rules`

Most of the game is automated by the bot: 
- players can use **/faction_battle** command to [start a battles](../discord_battle_rules/rules_01_how_battles_start.md);
- and **/faction_action** to do actions such as [moving units](../discord_battle_rules/rules_06_map_units.md) or [preparing attacks](../discord_battle_rules/rules_14_faction_actions.md);
- or multiple other commands such as **/faction_balance**, **/faction_craft** etc.

Most of these commands are only available to **Key faction members** - people who are authorized to have access to sensitive faction info and can perform actions or use resources on faction's behalf.

Faction are free to have their own processes to assign new key members using **/vouch_for** command.

There's also a special command **/send_gm_action** that can be used by any player to send the GM a message or "officially" confirm or request things.

Just use **/send_gm_action <text>** command and the bot will ping me in a special hidden channel.

> **/send_gm_action** PS declares that we love this factions game!

> **/send_gm_action** We agree to the terms and sign the contract with the Fighters Guild

> **/send_gm_action** We offer DC to trade lands with us for <...>

These actions are not binding to other players - they can still betray such the pacts or promises, but they are useful to have a record of what was "officially" agreed and when.
