## 1. How Battles Start

`ðŸ“‘ Battle Rules`

- Factions take turns attempting to capture territories, each cycle the order is random.

- Cycle is a set of battles, one for each faction + a [Corruption](../discord_battle_rules/rules_09_corruption.md) battle.

- Faction members are free to decide where to attack by voting or any other process agreed in the faction chat, the battle is can be started by any [Key faction member](../discord_battle_rules/rules_07_key_members.md) using **/faction_battle** command.

- A faction can only **attack neighbouring territories **(where land connection exists) **+ one over territory by sea.**

- A faction **has to announce their intention to attack it within two days** of the previous battle otherwise their turn will be skipped. They do not need to specify the exact time of the attack, nor the territory - just confirm the intention to take their turn.

- Minimum time between battles - **7 days** (7*24h=192h) after previous battle ended.

- Maximum time between battles - **10 days** (240h).

- Same territory can not be attacked twice in a row (does not apply to [Corruption](../discord_battle_rules/rules_09_corruption.md) attacking the land).
