## 6. Map Units

`ðŸ“‘ Battle Rules`

Each faction has *two* **Garrison** units and *one* of each - **Support** and **Saboteur** units to place on the map. Factions can move their units **between battles** using **/faction_action** bot command.

__**2 Garrisons**__ - defensive units, so they can only be places on the lands that faction owns. If a territory with a *Garrison* stationed on it is attacked, it gets a **+20 base Garrison bonus** at the start of the battle (similarly to *[Adjacency](../rules/rules_02_initial_bonus_points.md)* bonuses). Itâ€™s allowed to place both your *Garrison* units on the same territory for a double *Garrison* bonus.

__**Support**__ - faction places this unit on their own lands to boost *Adjacency* **+10 base bonus** in battles where this faction either attacking or defending. Does not give any bonus when the land with **Support** on it is attacked. 

__**Saboteur**__ - can be deployed on other factions' lands to try and catch their **Support** and erase its bonus. Has no effect for neutral faction.

Units only provide bonuses for factions directly involved in the battle - attacker or a defender. They do not give any bonuses for neutral side in the battle.

Unit bonuses are [doubled in capital sieges](../rules/rules_10_sieging_capitals.md).
