## 16. Resources

`📑 Battle Rules`

There are three primary resources:  
`🪨 Mineral Resources [MIN]`  
`🧪 Science Resources [SCI]`  
`⚡️ Energy  Resources [ERG]`

When the rules or item descriptions mentions RES - it means **any resource** (any ONE resource, no mixing).

**How resources are produced**

Each time you collect income with **/faction_collect_income**, your faction's lands contribute resources towards faction's inventory.

Each land generates one resource that cannot be changed, as determined via [this random roll](https://discord.com/channels/562910943848169472/1109586327328006274), apart from Timeless Desert which produces `⌛ Temporal Resources`.

The **base value is 1 RES.** However, production fluctuates - each 24h new **global** modifiers are randomly generated.
Example:
`🪨+` means **all** sources on the island produce 2 MIN today;
`🧪=` means **all** sources stay at base value of 1 RES today;
`⚡️-` means **all** production of this resource drops to 0 RES today.

RES productions is  each land can be halted in the following cases:
- if the land is attacked - for 5 eons;
- if the land changes owners - 10 eons.

**Timeless Desert** produces its own type of resources - `⏳ Temporal Resources [TMP]`. It can be transmuted into 2 units of any other resource, or 1 of each (3 total).
