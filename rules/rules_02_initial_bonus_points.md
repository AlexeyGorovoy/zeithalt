## 2. Initial Bonus Points

`ðŸ“‘ Battle Rules`

Battles usually start from non-zero score. The following bonuses are applied to the attacker or defender score (or both):

**Adjacency +10 base bonus**  - for each land of the same color as attacker or a defender, connected by land.

**Garrison and Supports unit bonuses** - explained in a [separate post](../rules/rules_06_map_units.md).

In case of the *attack on capital region*, some bonuses **are doubled** - rules about that [are located here](../rules/rules_10_sieging_capitals.md).

**[Here's an example from the actual battle](https://discord.com/channels/562910943848169472/995641432742297731/1179425462208966658)** (discord link)

> Note: in the rules you'll often find "base 10" or "base 20" regarding bonuses - this is because actual points are adjusted from time-to-time for the number of people playing the game.
>
> The example above assume x5 multiplier, so base 10 means 50pts, base 20 means 100pts.
