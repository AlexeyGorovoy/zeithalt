## 9. Corruption

`ðŸ“‘ Battle Rules`

Each cycle, after all factions have made their moves, it's a **Corruption** turn - an NPC force, which attacks a random land on the island and all factions can only defend (or abstain).

Since during a corrupted battle all faction are on the same side, there are no combo steals possible and bonuses do not get erased.

Basic rules:

- **Corruption** does a random roll to determine damage every several minutes;
- if **Corruption** reaches the goal first, it covers the whole area and the land is lost;
- if combined factions' score reaches the goal first, the land is defended and stays under control of its owner;

To determine the next **Corruption** target, a random roll is performed by GM a few days in advance before the battle, following these rules:
- **Corruption** cannot attack capitals;
- **Corruption** cannot attack the same land twice in a row;
- **Corruption** cannot attack the lands adjacent to its previous target;
- **Corruption** can attack the land where the previous normal battle just happened.

> *Example: The first corrupted battle happened in Timeless Desert, so all capitals, 6 adjacent lands and the Desert itself were excluded from the next random roll for Corruption attack.*

By participating in battles with Corruption, factions can [earn special items and get useful rewards](../rules/rules_11_battle_rewards.md).
