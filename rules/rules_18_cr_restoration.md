## 18. Post-CR Restoration

`üìë Battle Rules`

If factions lose the battle against Corruption, they can start a special action to restore the land. 

This is a three-stage process, each of them is started using a [battle action point](../rules/rules_14_faction_actions.md) and has an assigned gold price.

Upon successful completion, all stages will grant the faction which started it the `‚ò£Ô∏è CR Sample` item for their [corrupted artifacts](../rules/rules_13_corrupted_artefacts.md) research. 

Factions need to submit **/send_gm_action** to the GM to request the next stage of the Restoration Project.

Please note that at least one battle has to happen after the land was lost to Corruption, as in-lore, the land is considered to be way too dangerous right after the CR Fallout happens.
