## 5. How Winners Are Decided

`ðŸ“‘ Battle Rules`

Usually in battles the goal is set to 150 base points.

In this example multiplier is x10, so the goal is 1500 pts (multiplayer may be different in actual battles to adjust for the number of players.

MT is attacking and CI is defending.

**Example #1**
```
Attackers - 1500pts
MT - 800
DC - 700
Defenders - 700pts
CI - 600
DC  - 100

MT captures the land. 
```

**Example #2**
```
Attackers - 1500pts
MT - 700 
DC - 800 <-- here it DOES matter who scored more
Defenders - 70pts
CI - 600
DC  - 100

Even though it was MT's attack, DC overtook them and captured the lands!
```

**Example #3**
```
Attackers - 800pts
MT - 400 
DC - 400 
Defenders - 1500pts
CI - 1000 
DC  - 500 

CI successfully defended their own lands.
```

**Example #4**
```
Attackers - 800pts
MT - 400 
DC - 400 
Defenders - 1500pts
CI - 500 
DC  - 1000 <-- here it does NOT matter who scored more

Even though DC scored higher in defense, defending teams work together. 
CI successfully defended their own lands.
