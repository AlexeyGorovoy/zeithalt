### <a id="dd50" href="#a">↑</a> Aas Forest

`🖼️ Landmark`

Named after one of the old kings of the Mindtech Institute, A'as Forest is a lush and bountiful woods at the south of the faction that is considered as an ancient and the oldest place in the faction.

It is also where the previous capital of the MindTech Institute used to be.

Most of the people who live here presides near the borders or the eastern and southern parts of the region.

Although with little population, with the previous capital being here, it has many ancient and forgotten structures that lie around, with most of it being in the north-western part of the forest. The mystery around the forest stands there, where not in a mile radius can you see signs of fauna. Even people who pass here feels a chill in their spines, as if the forest is telling them to not set foot in those lands. Although shown in most books, no one but those at the Cortexian Hall holds the old books and ancient scrolls that might answer the mystery of to what may have happened there.

In the said population, most of them work as lumberjacks and craftsmen, supplying wood, wooden supplies, and even furniture to the rest of the faction. Some others work as farmers that tend the orchard trees around the forest, which produces many fruits that is either shipped as it is, pickled, made into jams, or other fruit-preserving methods.

Built on eon 495 by [MindTech Institute](#6550) - a few eons after the [Oblivious Battle on the Mire](<https://alexeygorovoy.github.io/zeithalt/timeline/#eon-491---the-oblivious-battle-on-the-mire>) that showed the MT planning and foresight department at arguably the lowest point.

This, essentially a lighthouse, served as a wake-up call to the MindTech citizens and simultaneously a reminder of where a clouded mind could lead even the brightest of people.

The beacon is not a dominant structure of the [Neuropolis](#b870) skyline during the day, but due to the clever positioning on the highest point, at night it can be seen from virtually anywhere in the capital.

### <a id="b710" href="#b">↑</a> Book of Balance

`📑 Term`

**Book of Balance** is a traditional book for the [MindTech Institute](#6550), which, however, does not have a direct connection to the Institute and presumably was written long before the Institute was even founded.

This is one of the few known books originating from the [Age of Darkness](#b750), the author (or likely multiple authors) of the book are unknown.

The Book of Balance teaches readers the topics of mindfulness and meditation, the importance of emotional awareness and self-control, and is generally directed towards improving one's cognitive abilities and decision-making skills.

It is customary among MindTech followers to give out copies of this book to friends a families outside the faction as a token of appreciation and gratitude. The highest of honour is *The Gift of Balance* - the act of gifting away the very same book the person has read themselves.

### <a id="f6d0" href="#b">↑</a> Brickland Fortress

`🖼️ Landmark`

Brickland Fortress is a harsh, mostly mountainous region acting as a buffer between the lands of the east and west.

It features huge mountain ranges that start on the south-easternmost border with the [Chaotic Plains](#8a30), extend into the middle part of the region, and then slowly bend in a U-shape toward [Mt. Pickles](#7490) as they divide the land into two parts: Eastern and Western Brickland.

The mountain ranges, which are named as [Brickspire Mountains](#50d0), house small amounts of gold and iron mines. However they also house the main economic source of the entire region - its numerous stone quarries.

The high quality stones are mined from quarries used both locally, as well as exported into different regions to supply a factions' demand for building materials.

There are numerous small fortifications scattered all around the Brickspire Mountains to protect these vulnerable yet important quarries and mining villages built around them from bandit attacks and act as local defence forces when the region needs protection in battles.

However, the main force that defends the entire region and acts as a one giant gate between the Western and Eastern parts is the Brickland Fortress itself. It is located in the tallest mountain of the entire region, has an enormous size and equally gorgeous appearance.

Although nowadays this fortress gives the name to the whole region, it is believed that during the [Age of Darkness](#b750) nomadic people had a different name for their home. Sadly that name is now forgotten and lost in time.

Western Brickland is a smaller part of the region. 

It consists of mostly hills and small mountains with the exception of small flat area shaped like a triangle connecting to the vast expanses of Chaotic Plains. While not many people reside here compared to its eastern counterpart, there are still a few small villages scattered around the area.

Eastern Brickland, in addition to being a larger part, has much more life and greenery. The number of mountains and the overall height of the region starts decreasing as it gets closer to Oblivion Mire and Cerene Vale. The mountains and hills are eventually replaced by a number of small forests along the borders with Cerene Vale and the [Southern Sea](#bda0).

The majority of Brickland Fortress's population lives in the Eastern Part - in its villages, but mainly in [Meadowridge](#c860) - the largest town of the entire region.

`🖼️ Landmark`

Started production on eon 761.

It is a life-long project and the place of eventual retirement of  _MCCACTUSSON_ esteemed member of the [Council of Minds](#7c90).

Despite the climate of Synaxos Fields not being well-fitted to the flora imported from the [Timeless Desert](#0130), the ingenius climate-altering contraptions designed and built by _MCCACTUSSON_ allowed for a striving business.

The factory provides a steady supply of cactus-related produce to the [Neuropolis](#b870) and nearby lands, eliminating the dangers and uncertainty that arise when such products are delivered from the Desert itself.

### <a id="0330" href="#c">↑</a> 🏢 Center for Anomaly Control

`🪧 Place` in [Neuropolis](#b870)

Center for Anomaly Control (CAC) was built on eon 511 by [MindTech Institute](#6550) under supervision of [Xiavente](#40a0), shortly after the [Disaster of Synaxos Fields](../timeline/eon0508.md).

With the access to the lands of [Synaxos](#7cc0) being extremely dangerous, the Center had to be constructed as close to it as possible, while maintaining the direct connection to [Neuropolis](#b870) for better supply lines in the emergency situation.

The Center for Anomaly Control served as a hub of operations during the [CR Restoration Research](#2390) and the _Synaxos Restoration Project_ soon after.

However, CAC did not escape its fair share of controversy, as the first weapon-grade [CR Artifacts](#a1a0) are believed to have been developed and tested on its grounds.

Later, the resources of the Center were used in Restoration Projects in other lands, including the ones held by other factions and to this day the CAC remains a crucial point of CR Research.

### <a id="3850" href="#c">↑</a> Cerene Vale

`🖼️ Landmark`

Lush valleys in the east and southern regions, while mostly barren sands in the north. The region of Cerene Vale holds great beauty and elegance while keeping in touch with the newest of innovations. It is also the farthest region among the faction, placed at the south-west, and has many people plus a popularity for tourism.

With most of its lands being fields of vegetables and grain productions, and its shores yielding many ocean bounties, people who live here make their living from agriculture and fisheries. The vegetables and grains farmed are either exported to the other regions in the faction or sold locally. While the caught fishes and shellfish are either sold in the markets, shipped to the neighboring coastal regions, or preserved using many preserving methods like drying.

The region's capital, Silent Gulf, is famous for having its seasonal festivals each year which brings many tourist across the faction to come, like the Allevanos Festival which celebrates the bountiful gifts of autumn. They're also famed for having many night markets and bazaars that showers people who come with stalls and shops of different cuisine that attracts many for having many types of food in one place.

*(Allevanos - The Valley's Blessings) (Autumn is when the crops are usually harvested)*

**📑 Term**

Special kind of glass that is forged from the Timeless Desert sand. Due to unique properties of the sand, Chronoglass is able to preserve snapshots of the world, frozen in time. 

The thicker glass - more sand for the light to come through, therefore further back in the past you can see. However, the thicker the glass is, the blurrier the image gets

It takes a very skillful craftsman to craft lenses which exactly 1 day, 1 week, 1 year "thick" are and clear enough to be usable. Such lenses can be combined to make more sophisticated devices such as chrono-telescopes, chrono-binoculars, etc.

People new to the chronoglass concept, can often be riddled by the question:  
*Would a mirror made of the chronoglass give you a reflection from your past self?*

The Council was restored on [Eon 755](../timeline/eon0755.md) following the fall of the ruthless dictator.

### <a id="08c0" href="#c">↑</a> Corrupted Gemstone

**📜 Item**

An artefact retrieved by **hexAgon** during the Defence of Timeless Desert.

Heavy sphere of matte black color that appears to be completely black most of the time, but occasionally pulsates with deep red color..

During the pulse the matte surface of the cube momentarily becomes completely smooth and transparent as if made of glass, revealing a broken black cube inside it before slowly fading back into its usual color.

It’s cold to the touch when it’s matte black, but too hot to hold it during the pulse.

It looks as if corruption itself is contained within the gemstone, but the true material it’s made of, its origin and potential power of it are unknown, recorded history of Zeithalt does not have any mentions of similar artefacts.

> As written by historians:
> 
> *It’s witnessed by other **MindTech Institute** members that when **hexAgon** first touched it, they became completely motionless and unresponsive for several minutes, as if fixed in time. **hexAgon** does not recollect it being several minutes, but rather just a fraction of a second, during which a sequence of images - a vision - quickly skipped through their mind.*

Since then other people have touched the gemstone, but got no visions from it. Also, it seems to be only pulsating in **hexAgon’s** hands - when others hold it, the gemstone stays matte black and cold.

It seems that the gemstone has bonded with **hexAgon** in some special way.

`📑 Term`

**Book of Balance** is a traditional book for the [MindTech Institute](#6550), which, however, does not have a direct connection to the Institute and presumably was written long before the Institute was even founded.

This is one of the few known books originating from the [Age of Darkness](#b750), the author (or likely multiple authors) of the book are unknown.

The Book of Balance teaches readers the topics of mindfulness and meditation, the importance of emotional awareness and self-control, and is generally directed towards improving one's cognitive abilities and decision-making skills.

It is customary among MindTech followers to give out copies of this book to friends a families outside the faction as a token of appreciation and gratitude. The highest of honour is *The Gift of Balance* - the act of gifting away the very same book the person has read themselves.

### <a id="6ee0" href="#g">↑</a> 🎮 G.A.M.E. Complex

`🖼️ Landmark` in [PEBKAC Peak](#f6f0)

The great minds at [Cybernetics Inc](#80b0) have come up with a new way to improve future human digital enhancement – video games.

Humans are notoriously inept at objectivity and have a remarkable ability to ignore or discard information that is inconvenient. Removing bias and enhancing information intake and processing capabilities is a key component of human improvement.

G.A.M.E. (Great AI-human Machine Enhancement) is a new gaming complex that will be constructed in _PEBKAC Peak_ that will be freely available to anyone. As people interact with it, a central server will log every action and feed the data into a learning algorithm. The algorithm will learn the decision-making process of humans and use machine learning to improve upon that process.

Planned future improvements include additional installations all over CI territories, better games, and improved data logging and processing. Eventually, the AI will have the ability to scrape data from other sources such as phones, computers, any connected device, and even publicly installed cameras.

The data will be used to imbue future humans with efficient, optimized pruning and sorting capabilities, reducing the number of problems between keyboards and computers.

### <a id="7c90" href="#h">↑</a> Headmaster of the Institute

`📑 Term`

A governing body of [MindTech Institute](#6550) that resides in [Cortexian Hall](#a610), consisting of recognized citizens, skilled warriors and prominent scholars of the faction.

The members of the Council are called _Masters_ and serve for life, or until they resign or are removed from the Council by the other members.

The leader of the Council is called the _Headmaster_, who also acts as a Headmaster of the Institute. Headmaster is elected among the Masters of the Council by the MindTech Institute followers (not limited to Masters).

The Council is as old as the faction itself, and its history ranges from the ultimate power on the island during the times it was led by [hexAgon](#f910) to the complete dissolution during the times of [Loki](#5850)'s dictatorship.

The Council was restored on [Eon 755](../timeline/eon0755.md) following the fall of the ruthless dictator.

### <a id="f910" href="#h">↑</a> hexAgon

`🧙‍♂️ Character`

He is a member of the Council of Minds, founder of the *Interfactional Poetry Contest* as well as one of the top fighters under the orange flag but not much is known about him.


His date and place of birth are unknown and very little is known about his actual residence: it is rumored that he lives in an invisible tower in the Institute's Fortress in Neuropolis and that he has a non-human creature as a servant and confidant.

Opinions about him are conflicting: for some he is the spiritual guide of the Institute, for others he is just a troublemaker.

Those who studied in the Fortress describe him as the headmaster of the Institute as well as a teacher of Ancient Runes. His lessons are judged by everyone to be "*extremely boring*".

It seems that he is in possession of [a rare artifact](#08c0) found in the dunes of the [Timeless Desert](#0130) after the first battle against Corruption (eon 272): there is not much information about it.

They say he has a weakness for chocolate cookies.

At some point [Double-Z](#fad0) was hyping rumours that hexAgon might be addicted to drinking baby unicorn blood, however that story remains unconfirmed and is believed to be a newspaper hoax

Opened to the public on eon 770, this memorial is primarily dedicated to the [MindTech Institute symbology](#cbe0) and culture, but also serves as an archive for symbols and signs used anywhere on the Island.

The main features of the Hill are the 100m flagpole of the [Official MT Flag](../refs/img/mt_peace_flag.png), and a smaller - 3/4 of that height - [Wartime MT flag](../refs/img/mt_war_flag.png).

What surround the main exposition, are rows and rows of flags and crests and banners for different departments of [MindTech Institute](#6550), MT regions, towns, villages, families, and even specific people.

At the foot of the Hill, there are several buildings belonging to the *Symbology Archives* - these are dedicated to storing and categorizing the symbology of the whole Zeithalt Island. 

From the symbols of the other factions, to the replica of the welcome sign of the famous [Valhalla Bar](#8de0), and to the corporate brand books of the [Cloudy Corporation](#4120) - the Archives are rumored to host truly *all* known symbols and signs of the Island.

### <a id="1b90" href="#h">↑</a> 🛖 House of Craftsmanship

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Synaxos Fields](#7cc0).

Commonly known as the *Artifice School of Crafts*, the House of Craftsmanship is situated at [Somnivale](#7850), [Synaxos Fields](#7cc0). It is famed for creating weapons and tools nigh-impossible to scratch nor break with forging practices dating back to the [MT](#6550)'s Age of Enlightenment.

The weapons created are not the highlight of this place but the students that study here. It is the third ranking school in the lands of MT and first in the field of craftsmanship. With their motto *"With the burning heat of our will, we forge our mind the path to zenith."*

Its most priced artifact, the *Dreamforge* (or the *Litunera-lleumeo*), said to have been created for the purpose of crafting high-grade weapons by infusing the mind of the crafter with the item forged. The weapon or tool crafted said to scale power depending on how willful its forger's mind is, and is too powerful to be held by any other than the crafter itself.

The forge is traditionally used for students graduating from the school, with their forged weapons being a sign of completion in the academe.

### <a id="e630" href="#i">↑</a> Illusion Cliffs

`🖼️ Landmark`

A place so mystical you wouldn't believe it's real, Illusion Cliffs yields many beautiful beaches and wonderous caves that made it a popular tourism spot amongst people and is situated at the south-eastern part of the faction.
Home to more than a quarter of the population, it is the industrial and commercial capital of the whole MindTech Institute.

Most of the people here lives closely to the shores, and where most of the buildings, resorts, markets, and other structure for commerce of the faction is situated. Fishing and aquaculture are two of the most famous jobs people do. While the others work on market or stalls, the different resorts and production places, or entertainment and merchandise.

Many tourists here comes at day to appreciate the beautiful marble-white cliffs that is painted into a chroma of colors by the beautiful crystalline caves shimmered by the bright sunlight, or the enchanting blue shores at night when the moonlight strikes the waters and creates the illusion of a mirror world on the other side of the ocean.

But the truly, most wonderous view in the region is right by the farthest edge of the Aurora Cliffs. As the ocean gives birth to the other world, and the sunlight wakes the colors underground, a wave of australis seeps through the skies of dusk and dawn that brings down the universe to earth.
This phenomena happens every winter solstice and is when most of the tourists comes to the region.

`📜 Item`

> (Scientific Name: *Isynthillicus Cyrciniae*)

Also known as the "Pathfinder Stone", this ancient gemstone is created at the [center-point](#0130) of the lands of Zeithalt by the continuous pressure given by the physical and mystical force above and below the land.

The stone emanates a bright white light when first seen that will make the beholder temporarily immune or lengthen any illusionary and temporal effects, depending on the will of the holder. Although the quality of the stone may affect how strong the effectivity would be.

These stones, though, are very rare due to it taking hundreds of years to form and being very difficult to find as the [Desert](#0130) where they are made are famous for being a place where you can easily get lost or lose your way, leading to many adventurers never coming back.

`🧙‍♂️ Character`

Loki is a famous (or some may say infamous) MT member that quickly rose through the ranks to the position of Defense Minister and eventually became a [MindTech Institute](#6550) dictator.

His story includes a range of diverse moments: from being a humble owner of the [Valhalla Bar](#8de0) to dark allegations of killing the preceding Defense Minister of MindTech.

But it's the [Burning of Cerene Vale](../timeline/eon0749.md) that will forever be associated with his name, as a brutal outburst of unnecessary violence, event for which the full responsibility was taken by Loki himself.

This very same event is quoted to be the sole reason for his downfall and the [restoration of the Council of Minds in MT on eon 755](../timeline/eon0755.md).

The building houses the seat of government: the [Council of Minds](#7c90). Many rooms are not open to the public and their use is unknown.

The Towers, distinguished by a colour, are: 
- the *Orange Tower*, which hosts the students, candidates to be part of the Institute.
- the *Blue Tower* is reserved for members of the Institute who study the culture of the southwestern faction, [Delta Collective](#8bc0).
- finally, the *Green Tower* hosts the members who deal with everything related to the northern faction, [Cybernetics Inc](#80b0).

- Lessons relating to the faction being studied take place in the Blue and Green Towers.

The classrooms for ordinary subjects (Philosophy, Medicine, Psychology, etc.) are located in the Orange Tower.

Some claim that, especially at the end of the day when the sun's rays are very low, it is possible to see a fourth Tower, called by these witnesses "*Red Tower*" probably due to the color of the sunset.

Building located in the heart of Neuropolis, consists of two structures: an external perimeter in which the walls made up of 50 meter high obsidian blocks are interspersed with eight towers.

The two eastern walls overlook the sea: they were built on the rocks of the Gulf of Neuropolis and are perpetually hit by the violent waves of the sea.

On the sea side there are three towers: the *Seagull Tower* to the south-east, the *Medusa Tower* to the north-east and, in the center of the eastern side, the *Shark Tower*.

Two other walls, those on the innermost side, were built on the crest of *Mount Delirium* (an extinct volcano): on the top stands the western tower, *Eagle Tower*.

Inside the perimeter walls are located the stables, the garage, the structures reserved for the soldiers (the dormitories, the hospital, the canteen, the training rooms, the leisure areas).

Each perimeter tower contains officers' quarters, transmission rooms and observation points. Towers and walls are heavily armed.

Inside the perimeter there is the *Forest of Bitter Regrets*, where mainly willows grow, and the *Lake of Doubts*, surrounded by a perpetual fog due to the underground thermal springs that feed it.

Trees and fog hide the view of the structure built in the center of the perimeter, the actual Fortress.

### <a id="cbe0" href="#m">↑</a> MindTech Triquetra

`📑 Term`

Officially adopted on eon 768 by the [Council of Minds](#7c90), these symbols are derived from the ancient [MindTech](#6550) symbols used in the times of the [First Capital](#5570).

The following meanings are assigned to these symbols:

**The triquetra** the main symbol of the faction, symbolizes the tree [towers of MindTech Institute](#ea90).

**The surrounding circle** - for the control _MindTech_ has over the towers, and a reference to the mystic 4th tower.

The two giant bronze statues near the river entrance depicting the ancient and forgotten kings is one of the great landmarks they have to offer, which also tells those who travel by water that they have reached Neuropolis.
It is said that these statues were hundreds of years old and was build by the previous mental brotherhood when they moved the capital from the [A’as Forest](#dd50).

But what holds the greatest importance to them is the [Cortexian Hall](#a610), situated at the center point of the Cerebrime Peak.

In here, many of the greatest minds come and tell what they have found from researches and expeditions, and talk about problems that the country is and may be facing to find the solution in the best manner possible.
It contains many ancient books and scrolls that dates back to when the capital was still in the A'as Forest. It's also where the current leaders of the faction are staying.

### <a id="8840" href="#o">↑</a> Oblivion Mire

This place is mostly used for research purposes, and resource gathering since the place has many valuable materials that can be used for trade, medicine, and etc.

It is said that Oblivion Mire was once a great and lush jungle, filled with many flora and fauna that attracted the greatest of all adventurers. Even the old leaders of the Mindtech Institute lived here before for its beauty and peacefulness. No one really knows what made the place from it's beautiful picture to a now swamped image. Although, there are many books that says the reason why, like one that says it was an experimentation gone wrong, or some mystical and magical property disturbed.

Although barren and wastes, the region is still filled with many things yet to be explored or discovered, which is why there's a lot of research centers situated here. These research centers mainly study the earth and the trees, as long as the waters to solve what made the region into what it is now, and how they could fix it.

Started just as a piece of iron ore tied to a stick; this axe underwent many transformations made by numerous dubious smiths over its lifespan, until it eventually ended up in the masterful hands of the Chief Smith of the MindTech [House of Craftsmanship](#1b90).

That's when the axe was finally transformed into a weapon worthy to be wielded by a faction leader.

`🪧 Place` in [Neuropolis](#b870)

Built by [Cybernetics Inc](#80b0) on eon 457 during restoration of MT capital soon after [the siege](../timeline/eon0384.md).

This project brought the whole districts of [Neuropolis](#b870) up to the modern standard of infrastructure, greatly increasing the living conditions of lower-class citizens.

However, at the same time it is vastly criticised as a project enforced by [Cybernetics Inc](#80b0) against [MindTech Institute](#6550) will, and even partially aimed at diluting the unique culture of the MindTech capital.

### <a id="7cc0" href="#s">↑</a> Synaxos Fields

`🖼️ Landmark`

The beautiful lands of the north-east, with many hills, fields, and windmills that brings a fresh feel to anyone who visits.

Synaxos Fields holds huge and bountiful farmlands up north that makes up most of the faction's agricultural and domestication sectors, and many places of production and manufacturing that makes up most of its southern parts.

With most of its lands being for farming and tending animals, it's one of the most important region of the faction. It exports 76% of the products it produces with more than 50% of those being food that provides 36% of all the food the whole faction consumes. 

Most of the vegetables they farm are those that are easy to grow even on the harshest conditions, like Axean Potatoes, Ribean Rye, and Arrotian Roots. 

There are also animals domesticated here that are easy to care in tough conditions, like the Synaxean Ram and the Hemispherean Chickens.

The other half of the region are filled with places meant for production and manufacturing, lead by craftsmen and artisans who have refined and mastered their works on the arts of producing materials like leather, silk, paper, and many more. 

The people who come here are either businessmen or merchants who came to buy their products and sell it across the faction, or people who wish to learn the ways of the artisans and master their own craft.

### <a id="5480" href="#t">↑</a> The Arcanum

`📑 Term`

**The Arcanum**, also known as "The Secret Book" and "The Book of Secrets" is rumored to be the most important book in [MindTech Institute](#6550)'s teachings.

It is associated first and foremost with the [Masters of the Council](#7c90).

The common understanding is that each of the Masters has their own unique version of the book. This is indirectly proven by the lectures given in the Institute: even when Masters speak of the same topics, theirs readings of the book are vastly different.

The Arcanum cannot be read by anyone but the Masters of the Council, and the exact contents of it remain a closely guarded secret.

This paves the way for many conspiracy theories ranging from relatively modest - Masters starting to write their own version of the Arcanum when accepted into the Council; and to the obscure ones as the book being *[Timeless](#0130)* with each of the Masters reading literally different versions of it.

However, the most prevalent theory is actually a running joke that the book is in fact empty, and Masters are making up their lectures on the spot.

The Great Auditorium where the Council holds their meetings is one of the biggest indoor spaces of the island.

Often regarded as "the most important building on the Island" by MT followers, Cortexian Hall is definitely one for the MindTech Institute.

`🪧 Place`

It is a thirty-storey building with a vaguely triangular plan, surrounded by the [outer walls](#8a90). At each corner stands a tower, different from the others in shape and size.

The building houses the seat of government: the [Council of Minds](#7c90). Many rooms are not open to the public and their use is unknown.

The Towers, distinguished by a colour, are: 
- the *Orange Tower*, which hosts the students, candidates to be part of the Institute.
- the *Blue Tower* is reserved for members of the Institute who study the culture of the southwestern faction, [Delta Collective](#8bc0).
- finally, the *Green Tower* hosts the members who deal with everything related to the northern faction, [Cybernetics Inc](#80b0).

- Lessons relating to the faction being studied take place in the Blue and Green Towers.

The classrooms for ordinary subjects (Philosophy, Medicine, Psychology, etc.) are located in the Orange Tower.

Some claim that, especially at the end of the day when the sun's rays are very low, it is possible to see a fourth Tower, called by these witnesses "*Red Tower*" probably due to the color of the sunset.

There is no evidence that it actually exists.

Also known as the "Pathfinder Stone", this ancient gemstone is created at the [center-point](#0130) of the lands of Zeithalt by the continuous pressure given by the physical and mystical force above and below the land.

The stone emanates a bright white light when first seen that will make the beholder temporarily immune or lengthen any illusionary and temporal effects, depending on the will of the holder. Although the quality of the stone may affect how strong the effectivity would be.

These stones, though, are very rare due to it taking hundreds of years to form and being very difficult to find as the [Desert](#0130) where they are made are famous for being a place where you can easily get lost or lose your way, leading to many adventurers never coming back.

### <a id="f6d0" href="#w">↑</a> Western Brickland

`🖼️ Landmark`

Brickland Fortress is a harsh, mostly mountainous region acting as a buffer between the lands of the east and west.

It features huge mountain ranges that start on the south-easternmost border with the [Chaotic Plains](#8a30), extend into the middle part of the region, and then slowly bend in a U-shape toward [Mt. Pickles](#7490) as they divide the land into two parts: Eastern and Western Brickland.

The mountain ranges, which are named as [Brickspire Mountains](#50d0), house small amounts of gold and iron mines. However they also house the main economic source of the entire region - its numerous stone quarries.

The high quality stones are mined from quarries used both locally, as well as exported into different regions to supply a factions' demand for building materials.

There are numerous small fortifications scattered all around the Brickspire Mountains to protect these vulnerable yet important quarries and mining villages built around them from bandit attacks and act as local defence forces when the region needs protection in battles.

However, the main force that defends the entire region and acts as a one giant gate between the Western and Eastern parts is the Brickland Fortress itself. It is located in the tallest mountain of the entire region, has an enormous size and equally gorgeous appearance.

Although nowadays this fortress gives the name to the whole region, it is believed that during the [Age of Darkness](#b750) nomadic people had a different name for their home. Sadly that name is now forgotten and lost in time.

Western Brickland is a smaller part of the region. 

It consists of mostly hills and small mountains with the exception of small flat area shaped like a triangle connecting to the vast expanses of Chaotic Plains. While not many people reside here compared to its eastern counterpart, there are still a few small villages scattered around the area.

Eastern Brickland, in addition to being a larger part, has much more life and greenery. The number of mountains and the overall height of the region starts decreasing as it gets closer to Oblivion Mire and Cerene Vale. The mountains and hills are eventually replaced by a number of small forests along the borders with Cerene Vale and the [Southern Sea](#bda0).

The majority of Brickland Fortress's population lives in the Eastern Part - in its villages, but mainly in [Meadowridge](#c860) - the largest town of the entire region.

### <a id="b9a0" href="#x">↑</a> Xyrclaox Watch

`🖼️ Landmark`

The harsh bastion of the north, Xyrclaox Watch holds many of the training facilities for people who wants to join the ranks in battle and many of the institutions that holds people accountable or rehabilitates them to change. Although these places are mostly situated up north of the region, it is still guarded and is a difficult region to entry into.

The training facilities here are made for those who wants to enter military or law work. With its classes typically being more difficult than normal, and requires a lot of physical and mental work, only those with strong mindpower can overcome it.

A lot of the MindTech Institute leaders went here to train their minds not only in the league of knowledge and wisdom, but also in the forte of war tactics, demeanor, cunning, and many more.

It also holds many places where those who break the law gets sentenced or punished, and kept. Which is the main reason why the place is always heavily guarded. The biggest prison in the faction, [Prefrenial Prefect](#9850), is the most heavily guarded, with layers and layers of walls in all walls, roofs, and floors. It is said that once you get in here, it would take you days to get out, even if you're not a prisoner.
