## Book of Balance

`üìë Term`

**Book of Balance** is a traditional book for the [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md), which, however, does not have a direct connection to the Institute and presumably was written long before the Institute was even founded.

This is one of the few known books originating from the [Age of Darkness](../refs/age_of_darkness.md), the author (or likely multiple authors) of the book are unknown.

The Book of Balance teaches readers the topics of mindfulness and meditation, the importance of emotional awareness and self-control, and is generally directed towards improving one's cognitive abilities and decision-making skills.

It is customary among MindTech followers to give out copies of this book to friends a families outside the faction as a token of appreciation and gratitude. The highest of honour is *The Gift of Balance* - the act of gifting away the very same book the person has read themselves.
