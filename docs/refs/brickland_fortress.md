## Brickland Fortress

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark`

Brickland Fortress is a harsh, mostly mountainous region acting as a buffer between the lands of the east and west.

It features huge mountain ranges that start on the south-easternmost border with the [Chaotic Plains](../refs/chaotic_plains.md), extend into the middle part of the region, and then slowly bend in a U-shape toward [Mt. Pickles](../refs/mt_pickles.md) as they divide the land into two parts: Eastern and Western Brickland.

The mountain ranges, which are named as [Brickspire Mountains](../refs/brickspire_mountains.md), house small amounts of gold and iron mines. However they also house the main economic source of the entire region - its numerous stone quarries.

The high quality stones are mined from quarries used both locally, as well as exported into different regions to supply a factions' demand for building materials.

There are numerous small fortifications scattered all around the Brickspire Mountains to protect these vulnerable yet important quarries and mining villages built around them from bandit attacks and act as local defence forces when the region needs protection in battles.

However, the main force that defends the entire region and acts as a one giant gate between the Western and Eastern parts is the Brickland Fortress itself. It is located in the tallest mountain of the entire region, has an enormous size and equally gorgeous appearance.

Although nowadays this fortress gives the name to the whole region, it is believed that during the [Age of Darkness](../refs/age_of_darkness.md) nomadic people had a different name for their home. Sadly that name is now forgotten and lost in time.

Western Brickland is a smaller part of the region. 

It consists of mostly hills and small mountains with the exception of small flat area shaped like a triangle connecting to the vast expanses of Chaotic Plains. While not many people reside here compared to its eastern counterpart, there are still a few small villages scattered around the area.

Eastern Brickland, in addition to being a larger part, has much more life and greenery. The number of mountains and the overall height of the region starts decreasing as it gets closer to Oblivion Mire and Cerene Vale. The mountains and hills are eventually replaced by a number of small forests along the borders with Cerene Vale and the [Southern Sea](../refs/southern_sea.md).

The majority of Brickland Fortress's population lives in the Eastern Part - in its villages, but mainly in [Meadowridge](../refs/meadowridge.md) - the largest town of the entire region.
