## Neuropolis

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark`

The famed "house of wisdom and intelligence", the capital region of the Mindtech Institute holds the minds of many of the smartest people in the lands. Situated at the eastern-most part of the island, and is home to many of the government institutions.

What they hold most importance of is their universities, libraries, museums, research centers, et cetera. All of which contains knowledge of the past and present, which help make a better future for the faction.

The two giant bronze statues near the river entrance depicting the ancient and forgotten kings is one of the great landmarks they have to offer, which also tells those who travel by water that they have reached Neuropolis.
It is said that these statues were hundreds of years old and was build by the previous mental brotherhood when they moved the capital from the [A‚Äôas Forest](../refs/aas_forest.md).

But what holds the greatest importance to them is the [Cortexian Hall](../refs/cortexian_hall.md), situated at the center point of the Cerebrime Peak.

In here, many of the greatest minds come and tell what they have found from researches and expeditions, and talk about problems that the country is and may be facing to find the solution in the best manner possible.
It contains many ancient books and scrolls that dates back to when the capital was still in the A'as Forest. It's also where the current leaders of the faction are staying.
