## Purple Deeps

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark`

This city is the embodiment of chaos, there is no clear division into social classes and types. Surprisingly, the city of chaos is quite harmonious, because the **Security Department** monitors compliance with the norms, and violators are punished very strictly.

Chaos is quite an interesting thing, its representatives alone are not very dangerous, except that they can cause problems with their unpredictability.

But everything changes when  **Chaos Coordinator**s appear among them, they are able to direct uncontrolled power in the right direction for the **Council**. Coordinators are quite rare and very rarely leave the territory of their country. The capital is very changeable, and can meet a casual traveler both very good-naturedly and reject him without even letting him into its borders.
