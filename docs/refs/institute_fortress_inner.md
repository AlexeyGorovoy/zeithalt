## MindTech Institute Fortress (inner walls)

`ü™ß Place`

It is a thirty-storey building with a vaguely triangular plan, surrounded by the [outer walls](../refs/institute_fortress_outer.md). At each corner stands a tower, different from the others in shape and size.

The building houses the seat of government: the [Council of Minds](../refs/council_of_minds.md). Many rooms are not open to the public and their use is unknown.

The Towers, distinguished by a colour, are: 
- the *Orange Tower*, which hosts the students, candidates to be part of the Institute.
- the *Blue Tower* is reserved for members of the Institute who study the culture of the southwestern faction, [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md).
- finally, the *Green Tower* hosts the members who deal with everything related to the northern faction, [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md).

- Lessons relating to the faction being studied take place in the Blue and Green Towers.

The classrooms for ordinary subjects (Philosophy, Medicine, Psychology, etc.) are located in the Orange Tower.

Some claim that, especially at the end of the day when the sun's rays are very low, it is possible to see a fourth Tower, called by these witnesses "*Red Tower*" probably due to the color of the sunset.

There is no evidence that it actually exists.
