## ü¶Ñ UniCorn‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Farmlands

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark`

UniCorn was a relatively unknown family-owned farm that produced corn and related products.

The brand became known to a wider audience across the island with their hype product - _UniCorn Blood Whiskey_ the ad-campaign for which was based on the trending at the time rumors of [hexAgon](../refs/hexagon.md) being a baby unicorn blood drinker.

The company made this hoax into a reality, even featuring the hexAgon himself in one of their ads.

Even though there were no huge successes since then, it's still considered a business of local importance for the region of [Synaxos Fields](../refs/synaxos_fields.md).
