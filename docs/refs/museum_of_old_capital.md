## 🏛️ Museum of the Old Capital

`🖼️ Landmark`

Constructed on eon 761, the Museum contains the ancient [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) artifacts retrieved from the place of its first capital - [A'as Forest](../refs/aas_forest.md), such as scrolls, archives, book, art and much more.

This museum is believed to host the greatest collection of historical artifacts and knowledge on the whole Zeithalt Island, as it presents the results of meticulous work done by generations of MindTech scholars.

From the Shaushka runes describing the foundation of the [First Capital](../refs/first_capital.md), to the detailed maps of the old ruins of [A'as Forest](../refs/aas_forest.md) created ceonturies after its fall - the museum hosts it all, while the work to restore and rediscover the secrets of the _First Capital_ continues within its walls.
