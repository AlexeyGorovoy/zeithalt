The Particle Collider Of Little Light Items To Include Occupation Nonsense In Sands of Time (Particle COLLITIONIST) is the island's largest and only high-energy particle collider.

It was built by the Arcology Building for Operators of Desert Experiments (ABODE)  under supervision of [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) and with the help of other factions. Construction took place between E454 and E463.

It lies in a tunnel 34 kilometres (which in miles is 21) in circumference and as deep as 150 metres (which in inches is a different number) beneath the Timeless-Pickles border.
