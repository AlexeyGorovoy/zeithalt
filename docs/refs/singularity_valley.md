## Singularity Valley

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark`

Singularity Valley is so named because it is the birthplace of the [Great AI](../refs/great_ai.md). 

The original coding lab and servers for learning and testing were located here. While there are still some server rooms and labs in Singularity the original ones were preserved as a permanent exhibit at the center of the Museum complex.

This museum complex is the single most culturally significant structure to to [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) and while certainly not all, many young engineers make a pilgrimage journey to see and learn about the technology that brought us to where we are now.

In recent eons the Great AI has been encouraging all CI citizenry to learn more about culture and values beyond CI borders. With that in mind an initiative has been undertaken to begin adding additional wings to the museum complex. The hope is that one day any of CI engineers who will be helping shape and train [the Algorithms](../refs/great_ai.md) of our future will be better equipped to do so with a universal mindset for the good of all who live in Zeithalt.
