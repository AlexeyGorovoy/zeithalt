## üéåÔ∏è Hill of 1000 flags

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark` in [Paradox Pass](../refs/paradox_pass.md)

Opened to the public on eon 770, this memorial is primarily dedicated to the [MindTech Institute symbology](../refs/mt_symbology.md) and culture, but also serves as an archive for symbols and signs used anywhere on the Island.

The main features of the Hill are the 100m flagpole of the [Official MT Flag](../../refs/img/mt_peace_flag.png), and a smaller - 3/4 of that height - [Wartime MT flag](../../refs/img/mt_war_flag.png).

What surround the main exposition, are rows and rows of flags and crests and banners for different departments of [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md), MT regions, towns, villages, families, and even specific people.

At the foot of the Hill, there are several buildings belonging to the *Symbology Archives* - these are dedicated to storing and categorizing the symbology of the whole Zeithalt Island. 

From the symbols of the other factions, to the replica of the welcome sign of the famous [Valhalla Bar](../refs/valhalla_bar.md), and to the corporate brand books of the [Cloudy Corporation](../refs/cloudy_co_datacenter.md) - the Archives are rumored to host truly *all* known symbols and signs of the Island.
