## 💡 SmartHome Tech

`🪧 Place` in [Neuropolis](../refs/neuropolis.md)

Built by [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) on eon 457 during restoration of MT capital soon after [the siege](../timeline/eon0384.md).

This project brought the whole districts of [Neuropolis](../refs/neuropolis.md) up to the modern standard of infrastructure, greatly increasing the living conditions of lower-class citizens.

However, at the same time it is vastly criticised as a project enforced by [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) against [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) will, and even partially aimed at diluting the unique culture of the MindTech capital.
