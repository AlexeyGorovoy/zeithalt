## Oblivion Mire

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark`

The bridge to the western lands, Oblivion Mire is mostly uninhabited due to some natural phenomena that poisons the earth, the surrounding waters, and even the living.

This place is mostly used for research purposes, and resource gathering since the place has many valuable materials that can be used for trade, medicine, and etc.

It is said that Oblivion Mire was once a great and lush jungle, filled with many flora and fauna that attracted the greatest of all adventurers. Even the old leaders of the Mindtech Institute lived here before for its beauty and peacefulness. No one really knows what made the place from it's beautiful picture to a now swamped image. Although, there are many books that says the reason why, like one that says it was an experimentation gone wrong, or some mystical and magical property disturbed.

Although barren and wastes, the region is still filled with many things yet to be explored or discovered, which is why there's a lot of research centers situated here. These research centers mainly study the earth and the trees, as long as the waters to solve what made the region into what it is now, and how they could fix it.
