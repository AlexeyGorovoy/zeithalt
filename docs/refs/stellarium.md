## üåå Stellarium

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark` in [Indigo Shore](../refs/indigo_shore.md)

Built on eon 804 by [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md)

A planetarium that brings the experience of the stars to the people. The programming and shows concentrate on stars, constellations, the lifecycle of stars, and other star-related astronomical phenomena. Its structure is established in Indigo Shore, away from the bustling light and crowd mass of towns and cities, for a more immersive experience.

The main area of the Stellarium features a performance stage as the highlight of the place, with theatrical performances and musical shows running at alternate times. The stage delivers narrative experiences regarding the legend of the stars and their astronomical phenomena. Before the stage begins, visitors can view the exhibits at the entrance lobby that leads to the dome, where they can get the full experience of the stars, galaxies, and constellations.

The supporting facilities are split into three sections. One is the educational area, where there is an observatory deck nearby, with rooms for lectures and workshops not far from it. The other is the recreational area, where visitors arrive after experiencing the various shows in the main area. This area will have a caf√© and a gift shop to help with the revenue. Finally, there is the outdoor area, where visitors can watch the stars in great comfort with their own eyes.
