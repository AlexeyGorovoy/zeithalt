## Bloodvine

`üìë Term`

Bloodvine or a stranger vine is a type of carnivore plant that grows in the shallower parts of [Oblivion Mire](../refs/oblivion_mire.md). It's known for its strength with which the vines can pull in and even trap the largest of creatures.

The plant by itself has unassuming bright-green leaves on a thin stem and lays dormant in the small pools of water known as _bloodvine pits_. 

If disturbed, it'll quickly wrap around the object, tighten to the point of immobilizing the prey, and then the leaves of the wine will start to fall off and release the acidic black goo. 

The skin in contact with the goo starts to bleed, and the open wound gets further infected by the unhealthy swamp waters. The unprotected contact with the goo can lead to loss of a limb, or even death from infection and further complications.
