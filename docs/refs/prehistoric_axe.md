## 🪓 Prehistoric Axe

`📜 Item`

A crude battleaxe wielded by [Dino Saurex](../refs/curious_dino.md).

It is crafted from the very same meteorite that destroyed Dino's hometown. An event, after which the dinoman vowed to "fight the space back and avenge his family" - a promise which, 9-year-old Dino at the time, would later in life find very hard to keep.

Started just as a piece of iron ore tied to a stick; this axe underwent many transformations made by numerous dubious smiths over its lifespan, until it eventually ended up in the masterful hands of the Chief Smith of the MindTech [House of Craftsmanship](../refs/house_of_craftsmanship.md).

That's when the axe was finally transformed into a weapon worthy to be wielded by a faction leader.
