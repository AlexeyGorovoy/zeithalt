## Xyrclaox Watch

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark`

The harsh bastion of the north, Xyrclaox Watch holds many of the training facilities for people who wants to join the ranks in battle and many of the institutions that holds people accountable or rehabilitates them to change. Although these places are mostly situated up north of the region, it is still guarded and is a difficult region to entry into.

The training facilities here are made for those who wants to enter military or law work. With its classes typically being more difficult than normal, and requires a lot of physical and mental work, only those with strong mindpower can overcome it.

A lot of the MindTech Institute leaders went here to train their minds not only in the league of knowledge and wisdom, but also in the forte of war tactics, demeanor, cunning, and many more.

It also holds many places where those who break the law gets sentenced or punished, and kept. Which is the main reason why the place is always heavily guarded. The biggest prison in the faction, [Prefrenial Prefect](../refs/prefrenial_prefect.md), is the most heavily guarded, with layers and layers of walls in all walls, roofs, and floors. It is said that once you get in here, it would take you days to get out, even if you're not a prisoner.
