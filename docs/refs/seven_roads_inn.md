## 🍺 Seven Roads Inn

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Paradox Pass](../refs/paradox_pass.md)

Seven Roads is an inn and a tavern in Paradox Pass owned by the [Stonehaver](../refs/stonehavers) family and currently run by Young Olly Stonehaver.

It sits near the crossroads where a lesser known, but important [Syncrax Road](../refs/syncrax_road.md) branches off from the famous [Axonite Road](../refs/axonite_road.md) in a nearly perfect place for a tavern: no matter from which direction the traveler is arriving, as long as they set off at the break of dawn - they would reach the Seven Road Inn shortly before nightfall.

Due to this clever location, the Seven Roads Inn became a preferred resting place for generations of people travelling the [MindTech](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) lands, and rightfully evokes many warn feelings in the hearts of travelers.
