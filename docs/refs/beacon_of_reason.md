## 🕯️ Beacon for the Light of Reason

`🪧 Place` in [Neuropolis](../refs/neuropolis.md)

Built on eon 495 by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) - a few eons after the [Oblivious Battle on the Mire](<https://alexeygorovoy.github.io/zeithalt/timeline/#eon-491---the-oblivious-battle-on-the-mire>) that showed the MT planning and foresight department at arguably the lowest point.

This, essentially a lighthouse, served as a wake-up call to the MindTech citizens and simultaneously a reminder of where a clouded mind could lead even the brightest of people.

The beacon is not a dominant structure of the [Neuropolis](../refs/neuropolis.md) skyline during the day, but due to the clever positioning on the highest point, at night it can be seen from virtually anywhere in the capital.
