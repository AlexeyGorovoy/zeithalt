## Eon 779 - Cloudy Operative is founded

`⌛ Event`

After eons of preparations, the founders of the [Cloudy Operatives](../refs/cloudy_operatives.md) finally finish the process of establishing their new faction.

The faction is founded by the three former [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) Masters - [Bumps](../refs/bumps.md), [Shaxx](../refs/shaxx.md) and [CrAEX](../refs/craex.md), joined by a Silvan [You](../refs/you.md) and a sellswords [Eldar](../refs/eldar.md) and [Revalx](../refs/revalx.md).

The new faction is able to negotiate a deal with MindTech regarding the [Timeless Desert](../refs/timeless_desert.md) and now has it under their control.

The goal of the Cloudy Operatives is claimed to be the focus on the development of the Desert and its [resources](../refs/temporal_resources.md), as well as trade and economic prosperity. 

In their founding accords, the new faction vows not to take interest in any lands outside the Desert with the goal of achieving neutrality with other factions.
