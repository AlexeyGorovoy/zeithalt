## Eon 540 - Restoration of Oblivion Mire

`⌛ Event`

Peaceful collaboration between factions made response to corruption swift and timely - [Restoration Project](../refs/cr_restoration_project.md) is completed in [Oblivion Mire](../refs/oblivion_mire.md).

While these lands will forever remain scarred by the disaster and every man-made structure was destroyed while the event unfolded, _Oblivion_ now stands clear from [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md).

Since all population was evacuated previously from _Oblivion Mire_, it is currently a free land, not belonging to any faction.

The immediate danger is gone, but Zeithalt will remember _The Dark Night on the Mire_ and the lessons it taught us.
