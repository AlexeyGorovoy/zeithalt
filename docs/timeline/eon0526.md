## Eon 526 - The Recapture of Synaxos Fields

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md)

This was quite an unusual battle - for the first time in more than 270 eons that passed since the end of [Age of Conquest](../refs/age_of_conquest.md), all faction fought capture a free land.

[Cybers](../refs/cybers.md) and [Deltans](../refs/deltans.md) did not provide a remarkable presence on the battlefield, while [Silvans](../refs/silvans.md) saw this battle as an extension of clearing out the [Synaxos Fields](../refs/synaxos_fields.md) of the [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) and provided much more noticeable support.

[MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) had by far the most power in this battle, successfully completing _The Recapture Of Synaxos Fields_.
