## Eon 508 - The Disaster of Synaxos Fields

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md)

[Synaxos Fields](../refs/synaxos_fields.md) is a dead wasteland as factions fail to contain [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) surge.

Several new [Bank of Zeithalt](../refs/bank_of_zeithalt.md) policies are in order following an attempt to save the economy of the Island.

Many people suffered exposure to [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) - fate of those with severe cases is unknown at the moment of writing.

Most of [Synaxos Fields](../refs/synaxos_fields.md) is currently in uninhabitable state, many places just dangerous to be in due to [Corruption Fallout](../refs/cr_fallout.md).

For sure, factions will study the phenomenon in the coming eons to see if at least something is recoverable, but for now _Synaxos Fields_ is considered to be a dead land.
