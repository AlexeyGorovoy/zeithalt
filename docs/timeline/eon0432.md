## Eon 432 - The Battle of Corrupted Marshes

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) (combined faction forces)

In this battle factions once again stood strong against the [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md), winning with quite a margin.

However, this battles was not without surprises - [Deltans](../refs/deltans.md) forces were considerable more powerful than other factions, while [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) performance was so underwhelming, that [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) was the second best.
