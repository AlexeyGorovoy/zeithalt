`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md)

[Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) decides to retaliate on [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) with an unexpected attack on [Indigo Shore](../refs/indigo_shore.md) but fails to capture in the battle known as _Crash Landing on Indigo Shore_.

_Zeithalt historian took a break during this time, so there’s little or no written history of this event._
