## Eon 723 - 2nd Sabotage in the Desert

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md)

After failing to secure a contract with [Fighters Guild](../refs/fighters_guild.md), [Cybers](../refs/cybers.md) return to their previous tactic of sabotaging the [Timeless Desert](../refs/timeless_desert.md).

This tactic proves useful again, as the Cybers are able to trigger [CR Mines](../refs/cr_mines.md) and interrupt [Temporal Resource](../refs/temporal_resources.md) production in the region.

However, the battle itself was heavily dominated by [Deltan](../refs/deltans.md) forces helping MT defend, while Cybers and Silvans mostly conserved their forces for the upcoming MT retribution.
