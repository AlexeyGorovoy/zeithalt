## Eon 452 - Technological advancement - Taxes and Land Income

`⌛ Event`

In the time between battles [Bank of Zeithalt](../refs/bank_of_zeithalt.md) introduces taxes - land income and battle tax:
- battle tax is imposed upon faction members as a way to fill up faction treasuries;
- land income is collected by factions from the lands under their control.

Factions immediately started investing into their own economy by building land improvements that earn more income:
- [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) builds `💡SmartHome Tech` in [Neuropolis](../refs/neuropolis.md);
- [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) builds `🌿 Photosynthetic Power Station` in [A’as Forest](../refs/aas_forest.md).
