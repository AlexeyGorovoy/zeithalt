## Eon 330 - The Confusing Battle of Indigo Shore

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md)

The most notable events are [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) joining forces with MindTech Institute to attack [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) after a long period of 6 battle when DC and CI where united. 

Quite confusing for DC who were quick to call it a betrayal.

Also, in the epic meme moment [Loki](../refs/loki.md) got confused and defended in the middle of his faction’s attack. This brought massive embarrassment to him as he was also a King of the Server at the time and everyone paid attention to his actions.

All this confusion granted the battle its name - The Confusing Battle of [Indigo Shore](../refs/indigo_shore.md).
