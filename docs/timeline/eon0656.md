## Eon 656 - The Sabotage in the Desert

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md)

[Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) launches an attack on [Timeless Desert](../refs/timeless_desert.md)’s infrastructure in a battle known as _Sabotage in the Desert_.

As declared by the [Cybers](../refs/cybers.md), the goal of this attack wasn't to conquer the _Desert_, but rather to interrupt its production and weaken its defences.

The initial blow alone achieved both of these objectives. [Corrupted Mines](../refs/cr_mines.md) were triggered in the area, and the first attacks indeed disrupted [Temporal Resource](../refs/temporal_resources.md) production for several eons.

Afterward, the pace of the attacking activity slowed significantly, and the _MindTech Institute_ in a coalition with [Deltan](../refs/delta_collective.md) forces was able to secure victory in the battle, while [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) remained mostly neutral.

It's difficult to determine a clear "winner" in this battle, as both sides claim to have achieved their goals on the battlefield. What remains certain is that, even after seven battles, the _Desert_ still stands unconquered.
