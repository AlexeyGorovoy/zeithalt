## Eon 619 - The Reclamation of Imperial Swamp

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md)

[Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) attacks and claims [Imperial Swamp](../refs/imperial_swamp.md) in a battle known as _Reclamation of the Imperial Swamp_.

After a devastating loss to [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) and the following [restoration projects](../refs/cr_restoration_project.md) the _Imperial Swamp_ stood as unoccupied and CR-free land - a chance seen and seized by the _Protectores Silva_.

Prompted by [Silvans](../refs/silvans.md), the rush to capture the _Imperial Swamp_ started, but having used the [Corrupted Shards](../refs/cr_shards.md), the _Silvans_ were ahead of others the entire battle and secured the victory.
