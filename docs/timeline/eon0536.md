## Eon 536 - The Dark Night on the Mire

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md)

[Oblivion Mire](../refs/oblivion_mire.md) is uninhabitable as factions fail to contain _Corruption_.

[Bank of Zeithalt](../refs/bank_of_zeithalt.md) reinstates its policies that were in order during the previous [Corruption Fallout](../refs/cr_fallout.md) to minimize the damages to the Island’s economy.

Many people suffered exposure to _Corruption_ - luckily with recent developments we know that full recovery is possible, although it will take time to heal.

Most of [Oblivion Mire](../refs/oblivion_mire.md) is currently in uninhabitable state, many places just dangerous to be in due to _Corruption Fallout_.

As the last devastating news to the Islanders, renown [Valhalla Bar](../refs/valhalla_bar.md) is now also destroyed.

This night will be remembered as _The Dark Night on the Mire_.
