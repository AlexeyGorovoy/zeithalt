## Eon 596 - The Fall of Imperial Swamp

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md)

Some say after previous easy victory over _Corruption_ the factions became too reckless. Others say heavy suppression of the _Corruption_ last time caused it being overcharged this time, resulting in uncontrollable violent outburst…

Either way, the collective effort of factions wasn’t enough and [Imperial Swamp](../refs/imperial_swamp.md) falls - the land is currently uninhabitable and man-made structures, such as [Altar of Ctulhu](../refs/altar_of_ctulhu.md) and [Money Factory](../refs/money_factory.md), are destroyed.

[Bank of Zeithalt](../refs/bank_of_zeithalt.md) has declared the Island-wide state of emergency until the necessary [CR Restoration Project](../refs/cr_restoration_project.md) stages are completed to contain the threat.
