## Eon 367 - The Fishy Battle of Imperial Swamp

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md)

Cybernetics Inc attacks the [Deltans](../refs/deltans.md) and wins The Fishy Battle Of [Imperial Swamp](../refs/imperial_swamp.md).

A notable achievement for Cybers - it is their first victory in a battle against factions, allowing them to repeat the MT’s record of holding 10 lands at the same time.

[MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) mostly stayed out of it, adhering to their new policy of peacekeeping, although some MT players in pursuit of gold and fame were active during the battle.
