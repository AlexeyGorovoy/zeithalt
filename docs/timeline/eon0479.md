## Eon 479 - The Crawling Battle of Xyrclaox Watch

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md)

[The Watch’s](../refs/xyrclaox_watch.md) defenses prepared by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) are good and attackers have to come from a narrow path to the lands… This offensive was never going to be easy.

With [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) and [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) staying near perfectly neutral, this battle dragged on even more…

Since the beginning of the battle, [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) slowly but surely were closing the gap between them and the [Mind](../refs/minds.md), until in a final push they were able to secure the victory.

The careful, slow and intense nature of the battle has granted it its name - _The Crawling Battle of [Xyrclaox Watch](../refs/xyrclaox_watch.md)_.
