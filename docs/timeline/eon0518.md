## Eon 518 - Restoration of Synaxos Fields

`⌛ Event`

After spending enormous amounts of resources and doing extensive research factions collectively complete @[CR Restoration Project](../refs/cr_restoration_project.md) in [Synaxos Fields](../refs/synaxos_fields.md).

While these lands will forever remain scarred by the disaster and every man-made structure was destroyed while the event unfolded, Synaxos now stands clear from [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md).

Since all population was evacuated previously from [Synaxos Fields](../refs/synaxos_fields.md), it is currently a free land, not belonging to any faction.

Many on the Island are wondering of this means a future peaceful collaboration to restore  to former glory…. or a threat of a new bloody conflict for controlling the land is looming over it.
