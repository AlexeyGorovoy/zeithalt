## Eon 275 - Uprising in the Delta Collective

`âŒ› Event`

A bunch of people team up to seize control of the [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md).

The faction starts speaking [Deltan language](../refs/deltan_language.md) instead of the [Common language](../refs/common_language.md) spoken universally by the whole Zeithalt. 

[GreenOtter](../refs/greenotter.md) is deposed from being a leader of Delta Collective and is exiled from the faction.
