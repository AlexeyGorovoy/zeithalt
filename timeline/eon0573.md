## Eon 573 - The Battle of Corrupted Valley

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) (combined faction forces)

Factions are able to put aside their differences and arguments to fend off [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) in the [Singularity Valley](../refs/singularity_valley.md).

[Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) in coordination with other factions did a very good job preparing for the battle - [Corrupted Mines](../refs/cr_mines.md) were installed, defenses strengthened, fortifications built… it all paid off in the end.

As expected after two violent _Corruption_ outbursts, it seems to have released some of its pressure and this battle proved to be easier.

On the other hand, it means the next battle will be harder.
