## Eon 818 - Blitz Battle of the A'as Forest

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md)

It was a quick and decisive battle where the attacking MindTech forces were ahead of their opposition by a colossal margin.

First of all, Minds prepared greatly for this battle, and attacked A'as from three sides simultaneously, almost trapping the opposing [PS](../refs/protectores_silva.md) and [CI](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) troops in the process.

Secondly, _Minds_ were able to secure contracts with both [Fighters' Guild](../refs/fighters_guild.md) and [Cloudy Operatives](../refs/cloudy_operatives.md) to further increase their numbers.

Lastly, [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) - who are currently considered to have the strongest army on the Island - once again proved to be a reliable ally and provided them with the necessary support.

As a result, the battle was decided in a matter of hours - the attackers had vastly superior force, and the battle was finished quickly.
