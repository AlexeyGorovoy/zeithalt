## Eon 666 - The Spooky Battle of Chaotic Plains

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) (combined faction forces)

[Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) strikes [Chaotic Plains](../refs/chaotic_plains.md) causing a _Spooky Battle of Chaotic Plains_, which, however was closely won by collective factions’ effort.

_Zeithalt historian took a break during this time, so there’s little or no written history of this event._
