## Eon 755 - Council of Minds is restored in MT

`âŒ› Event`

Following the blatant and brutal [Burning of Cerene Vale](../timeline/eon0749.md), the [Loki](../refs/loki.md)'s fall and simultaneous restoration of democratic institutes in MindTech begin.

At the same time as democratic and inclusive elections are announces in [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md), the former tyrant leader is detained and held captive in [Prefrenial Prefect](../refs/prefrenial_prefect.md), awaiting a trial. 

The elections result in a landslide victory for [CuriousDino](../refs/curious_dino.md), who immediately assumes office as the MT Head of State and reestablishes the [Council of Minds](../refs/council_of_minds.md) as the governing body of MindTech. 

Following eons become very busy for the newfound government: the new government structure is approved by the absolute majority of the Council; several cross-faction proposals are put forward and voted on; Loki is transferred to [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) for trial.

While from the outside of the faction these changes are barely noticeable and the faction still struggles to find understanding from other factions, the internal changes seem to be drastic and ambitious. 

Which begs the ultimate question - will it start a new, more peaceful era for MindTech, or will it collapse back into the war and destruction yet again?
