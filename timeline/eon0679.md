## Eon 679 - The Defense of Dev Null Marsh

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md)

[Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) attacks [Dev Null Marsh](../refs/dev_null_marsh.md), starting a battle known as _Defense of Dev Null Marsh_.

It was practically won by a clever use of _Special Tactics_ and [resources](../refs/resources.md) by [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md).

_Zeithalt historian took a break during this time, so there’s little or no written history of this event._
