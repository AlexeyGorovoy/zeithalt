## Eon 306 - The Boring Battle

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md)

[MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) attacks [Brickland Fortress](../refs/brickland_fortress.md), however the battle ends early as the Minds realise that they cannot win this battle.

All sides of the conflict just agree to cut it short it and give the victory to Delta Collective, who keep their lands.

Due to this unusual even the battle is known as The Boring Battle.
