## Eon 349 - MT support the effort for peace

`⌛ Event`

⏳ The [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) passes their attack turn with the following message:

> The Institute's Minds welcome this idea of the Cybernetics brothers and answer to the call for peace in similar manner.
> 
> We wish to not participate in combat during this cycle and pass out turn as well. Instead, we use this time to help the restoration works of the damaged circuits in the Cybertron Jungle and to further improve and evolve our own lands and minds alike.
> 
> Let the island of Zeithalt enter a new era, let it prosper in peace and harmony!
