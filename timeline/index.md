## Eon 723 - 2nd Sabotage in the Desert

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md)

After failing to secure a contract with [Fighters Guild](../refs/fighters_guild.md), [Cybers](../refs/cybers.md) return to their previous tactic of sabotaging the [Timeless Desert](../refs/timeless_desert.md).

This tactic proves useful again, as the Cybers are able to trigger [CR Mines](../refs/cr_mines.md) and interrupt [Temporal Resource](../refs/temporal_resources.md) production in the region.

However, the battle itself was heavily dominated by [Deltan](../refs/deltans.md) forces helping MT defend, while Cybers and Silvans mostly conserved their forces for the upcoming MT retribution.

## Eon 384 - The Siege of Neuropolis

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md)

In a dramatic battle, alliance of [Deltans](../refs/deltans.md) with [Cybers](../refs/cybers.md) gathered together a great force both in battle and in financial effort, and successfully conquered the heart of [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) -  their capital city [Neuropolis](../refs/neuropolis.md).

Historians noticed that [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) did not immediately rushed to the aid, but joined after a few attacks - either due to the surprising nature of the attack, or they were negotiating something the [Minds](../refs/minds.md)…

This epic battle will be remembered in chronicles as _The Siege of Neuropolis_, first ever attack and successful capture of a faction’s capital.

When faced with a choice whether to keep the city or let Neuropolis burn to the ground, Delta Collective decided to save the city.

All the fires remaining after battle were promptly put out, the immediate restoration of city walls began, Deltan officials started the effort to restore peaceful life in the city.

A notable achievement for Cybers - it is their first victory in a battle against factions, allowing them to repeat the MT’s record of holding 10 lands at the same time.

[MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) mostly stayed out of it, adhering to their new policy of peacekeeping, although some MT players in pursuit of gold and fame were active during the battle.

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0367.png)
## Eon 359 - The Battle of Corrupted Forest

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) (combined faction forces)

[A’as Forest](../refs/aas_forest.md) is successfully defended by the combined forces of three factions.

Honorable mention - MTs battle commander [Revalx](../refs/revalx.md), for doing impressive work in organising the people of all factions.

Other notable events include:
- Record low participation from [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md);
- MindTech Institute not using their [Garrisons](../refs/garrisons.md) nor [Corrupted Mines](../refs/cr_mines.md) to help the defence;
- it’s a _very_ close call again, the outcome of the battle decided in the very last moments.

Reports say that [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) and  were able to gather enough corrupted matter and complete (separately) their own [CR Research](../refs/cr_artefacts.md) projects.

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0359.png)
## Eon 353 - Corruption research in full swing

`⌛ Event`

Predictions about [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) targets are no longer based on rumours and prophecies.

Due to ongoing peace, factions have set up an extensive network of control stations and research facilities all over the island.

Based on the observations done by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) scientists, it is reported that the first signs of approaching [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) are appearing in [A’as Forest](../refs/aas_forest.md).
## Eon 352 - DC calls off an attack

`⌛ Event`

After two other factions skipped their turns in hopes to preserve peace, [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) decided to join this effort and too will not attack at this time.

## Eon 351 - CI and DC exchange lands

`⌛ Event`

## Eon 349 - MT support the effort for peace

`⌛ Event`

⏳ The [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) passes their attack turn with the following message:

> The Institute's Minds welcome this idea of the Cybernetics brothers and answer to the call for peace in similar manner.
> 
> We wish to not participate in combat during this cycle and pass out turn as well. Instead, we use this time to help the restoration works of the damaged circuits in the Cybertron Jungle and to further improve and evolve our own lands and minds alike.
> 
> Let the island of Zeithalt enter a new era, let it prosper in peace and harmony!
## Eon 347 - CI calls for peace

`⌛ Event`

Still working on repairs and seeing so much destruction around them from the recent corruption strike, [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) made a call for the idea of peace within the Island. 

CI have taken that first step themselves and chose not to engage in a new battle.
## Eon 345 - The Battle of Corrupted Jungle

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) (combined faction forces)

In this very close battle after several hours of fighting everyone was on edge till the very last minute. Though great cooperation the factions have once again defeated the [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) threat.

It is believed, however, that some [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) have intentionally not participated in the hope that [Cybertron Jungle](../refs/cybertron_jungle.md) would fall. It’s just a suspicion, but this idea can be poisonous for future politics on the island.

During the battle [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) members were able to gather enough corrupted matter to synthesize [Corrupted Mines](../refs/cr_mines.md) - powerful defensive weapon, first of its kind on Zeithalt.

## Eon 339 - CR Outburst is predicted to happen in Cybertron

`⌛ Event`

he preachers across Zeithalt once again speak of the dangers [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) brings to the Island… this time [Cybertron Jungle](../refs/cybertron_jungle.md) is said to be affected.
## Eon 338 - The 3rd Battle of Mt. Pickles

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md)

The [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) and MindTech Institute alliance stands strong, bringing more benefits to the mind faction. Notably, [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) was able to put up the great fight, gathering more points than the [Minds](../refs/minds.md).

During this battle your fellow historian mostly slept and been busy with stuff, so this battle bears no special name. It’s just known as The 3rd Battle of Mt. Pickles.

Two times in a row [Cybers](../refs/cybers.md) help the Minds win new lands from [Deltans](../refs/deltans.md)… which brings us to the question - what’s in it for Cybernetics Inc?

With the upcoming [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) battle, we will see if the factions are able to unite under new circumstances or if the political quarrels mean more to them than the fate of the Zeithalt Island…

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0338.png)
## Eon 330 - The Confusing Battle of Indigo Shore

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md)

The most notable events are [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) joining forces with MindTech Institute to attack [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) after a long period of 6 battle when DC and CI where united. 

Quite confusing for DC who were quick to call it a betrayal.

Also, in the epic meme moment [Loki](../refs/loki.md) got confused and defended in the middle of his faction’s attack. This brought massive embarrassment to him as he was also a King of the Server at the time and everyone paid attention to his actions.

All this confusion granted the battle its name - The Confusing Battle of [Indigo Shore](../refs/indigo_shore.md).

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0330.png)

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md)

Having won all previous battles, [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) is now believed the most powerful faction on the Island. They attack [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md)'s [Brickland Fortress](../refs/brickland_fortress.md) hoping to catch DC in their weakest moment.

However, the influx of new warriors in Delta Collective and their ability to negotiate an alliance with [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) despite recent Deltan attack helps to change the tides and win the battle.

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0280.png)

This battle starts as a [Deltan](../refs/deltans.md) attack on [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md)'s [Dev Null Marsh](../refs/dev_null_marsh.md). 

Unexpectedly the MindTech Institute joins the attack, which causes confusion in both Cybers ranks and the Institute itself.

During the battle Minds temporarily start helping Cybers defense, but eventually switch back to the attack and win the battle.

This battle is the starting point of the mutual hatred between Cybers and Minds, that would last for hundreds of Eons to come.
