`‚åõ Event`

[Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) gives control over [Blue Screen Lagoon](../refs/blue_screen_lagoon.md) to [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) upon their mutual agreement.

## Eon 723 - 2nd Sabotage in the Desert

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md)

After failing to secure a contract with [Fighters Guild](../refs/fighters_guild.md), [Cybers](../refs/cybers.md) return to their previous tactic of sabotaging the [Timeless Desert](../refs/timeless_desert.md).

This tactic proves useful again, as the Cybers are able to trigger [CR Mines](../refs/cr_mines.md) and interrupt [Temporal Resource](../refs/temporal_resources.md) production in the region.

However, the battle itself was heavily dominated by [Deltan](../refs/deltans.md) forces helping MT defend, while Cybers and Silvans mostly conserved their forces for the upcoming MT retribution.

## Eon 463 - DC gives Ares Gardens to PS

`‚åõ Event`

[Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) gives control over [Ares Gardens](../refs/ares_gardens.md) to [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) upon their mutual agreement.

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0463.png)
## Eon 462 - The 2nd Siege of Neuropolis

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md)

Quite surprisingly, in this battle [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) - known for their chaotic and warring spirit - seemingly decided to follow [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) steps, as both these faction stayed neutral.

[Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) defending effort was good, but well outmatched by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) attacking power.

Important thing to note is that during this battle the deal between [Cybers](../refs/cybers.md) and [Minds](../refs/minds.md) to trade [Paradox Pass](../refs/paradox_pass.md) (becomes CI land) for [Illusion Cliffs](../refs/illusion_cliffs.md) (goes to MT) was uncovered, raising more questions from other factions.

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0462.png)
## Eon 452 - Technological advancement - Taxes and Land Income

`‚åõ Event`

In the time between battles [Bank of Zeithalt](../refs/bank_of_zeithalt.md) introduces taxes - land income and battle tax:
- battle tax is imposed upon faction members as a way to fill up faction treasuries;
- land income is collected by factions from the lands under their control.

Factions immediately started investing into their own economy by building land improvements that earn more income:
- [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) builds `üí°SmartHome Tech` in [Neuropolis](../refs/neuropolis.md);
- [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) builds `üåø Photosynthetic Power Station` in [A‚Äôas Forest](../refs/aas_forest.md).

## Eon 451 - The Blitz Battle of Peace Death Gorge

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md)

[Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) gather considerable power of own men and hired sellswords to organize a successful blitz attack on [Peace Death Gorge](../refs/peace_death_gorge.md), reclaiming this land back under control.

Both [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) (defending side) and [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) (staying neutral, as usual) keep very low profiles, having almost no effect on the outcome of the battle.

[MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) quite unexpectedly joins the offensive. It‚Äôs unclear if their intervention was an effort to help the [Deltans](../refs/deltans.md), or an attempt of hijacking their attack. Either way, [Minds](../refs/minds.md) power was not enough to contest the confident win by [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md).

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0451.png)
## Eon 441 - The Lakeside Battle of Webified Hills

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md)

In a stunning and unexpected attack near the [Lake Corsair](../refs/lake_corsair.md), [Cybers](../refs/cybers.md) reclaim their lands in _The Lakeside Battle of [Webified Hills](../refs/webified_hills.md)_.

[Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) valiantly attempts to defend the territory but are ultimately unsuccessful due to bad preparation - they clearly were expecting an attack somewhere else, having almost no defense setup in the [Hills](../refs/webified_hills.md).

Notable that [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) strongly supported the Cybers‚Äô attack, however some of their members and paid sell-swords did hits helping [Deltan](../refs/deltans.md) defenses too.

[Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) stayed true to their resolve of being a neutral force, hitting equally for both sides to earn some gold.

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0441.png)
## Eon 425 - PS passes their attack turn

`‚åõ Event`

[Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) passes their tack turn again.

## Eon 432 - The Battle of Corrupted Marshes

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) (combined faction forces)

In this battle factions once again stood strong against the [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md), winning with quite a margin.

However, this battles was not without surprises - [Deltans](../refs/deltans.md) forces were considerable more powerful than other factions, while [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) performance was so underwhelming, that [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) was the second best.

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0432.png)
## Eon 425 - PS passes their attack turn

`‚åõ Event`

[Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) passes their tack turn with the following message to other factions:

> *PS is happy we see no reason to attack another faction. We're busy with our restorative efforts on Zeithalt and hope all other factions will help us in our important work.*

## Eon 423 - The Foolish Battle of Timeless Desert

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md)

In this daring attack [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) severely miscalculated and misinterpreted the current situation and launched unsupported attack on [Timeless Desert](../refs/timeless_desert.md).

Met by the defense of all 3 other factions, this attack was destined to fail from the beginning, given this battle its title - _The Foolish Battle of Timeless Desert_.

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0423.png)
## Eon 419 - 3-way land exchange between CI, MT and PS

`‚åõ Event`

[Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md), [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) and [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) exchange lands in a three-way agreement:
 - [Brickland Fortress](../refs/brickland_fortress.md) is now under control of [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md);
 - [Mt. Pickles](../refs/mt_pickles.md) is now under control of [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md);
 - [Synaxos Fields](../refs/synaxos_fields.md) is now under control of [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md).

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0419.png)
## Eon 418 - CI and DC exchange lands

`‚åõ Event`

[Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) and [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) exchange lands upon their mutual agreement:
- [Peace Death Gorge](../refs/peace_death_gorge.md) is now under control of [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md);
- [Webified Hills](../refs/webified_hills.md) are now under control of [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md).

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0418.png)
## Eon 413 - The Battle of Legoland Fortress

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md)

This battle is dubbed ‚Äúof Legoland Fortress‚Äù my some MT members because after two failed attempts, on the third try the [fortress](../refs/brickland_fortress.md) finally crumbled.

This battle questionably marks the end of [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) and [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) partnership, as [Deltans](../refs/deltans.md) are left unsatisfied by [Cybers](../refs/cybers.md) underwhelming participation in battle.

On the other hand, only a fraction of Cybers supported MT in this battle, what probably left [Minds](../refs/minds.md) unimpressed too.

The tensions are rising, alliances are shaking. It seems only [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) manages to not worsen it‚Äôs position in this battle, by keeping low profile - a position, understandable for a small and so far a peaceful faction.

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0413.png)
## Eon 407 - CI and MT exchange lands

`‚åõ Event`

[Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) and [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) exchange lands upon their mutual agreement:
- [Blue Screen Lagoon](../refs/blue_screen_lagoon.md) is now under control of [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md);
- [Illusion Cliffs](../refs/illusion_cliffs.md) are now under control of [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md). 

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0407.png)
## Eon 402 - The Night Battle of Paradox Pass

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md)

[Minds](../refs/minds.md) were able to defend their lands in this battle, with the help of [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) (and some [Deltan](../refs/deltans.md) involvement in the end of the battle).

Worth noting that both MT garrisons were located in the area, greatly helping with defences - as if Minds wildly gambled or been informed of the attack.

This battle happened at night time for most of the participants and took longer than usual to finish, granting its name - The Night Battle of [Paradox Pass](../refs/paradox_pass.md).

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0402.png)
## Eon 391 - 2nd Battle of Corrupted Desert

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) (combined faction forces)

The participation was high and battle ended rather quickly.

Due to various factors and the recent spike in activity and commitment, this battle against the [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) was less intense than the last one and many think it was won much easier this time.

Does it mean that the next time the [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) will strike harder?

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0391.png)
## Eon 386 - DC and CI exchange lands 2 for 2

`‚åõ Event`

[Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) and [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) reach an agreement to exchange lands:
- [Neuropolis](../refs/neuropolis.md) and [Synaxos Fields](../refs/synaxos_fields.md) (captured by Deltans) go to Delta Collective;
- [Indigo Shore](../refs/indigo_shore.md) and [Dev Null Marsh](../refs/dev_null_marsh.md) got to Cybernetics Inc.

![Battle Map Eon](../timeline/map/eon0386.png)
## Eon 384 - The Siege of Neuropolis

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md)

In a dramatic battle, alliance of [Deltans](../refs/deltans.md) with [Cybers](../refs/cybers.md) gathered together a great force both in battle and in financial effort, and successfully conquered the heart of [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) -  their capital city [Neuropolis](../refs/neuropolis.md).

Historians noticed that [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) did not immediately rushed to the aid, but joined after a few attacks - either due to the surprising nature of the attack, or they were negotiating something the [Minds](../refs/minds.md)‚Ä¶

This epic battle will be remembered in chronicles as _The Siege of Neuropolis_, first ever attack and successful capture of a faction‚Äôs capital.

When faced with a choice whether to keep the city or let Neuropolis burn to the ground, Delta Collective decided to save the city.

All the fires remaining after battle were promptly put out, the immediate restoration of city walls began, Deltan officials started the effort to restore peaceful life in the city.

![Battle Map Eon](../timeline/map/eon0384.png)
## Eon 375 - The 4h Battle of Mt. Pickles

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) (military exercise)

With the help of [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) and [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md), the [Silvans](../refs/silvans.md) were able to defend their lands the MT attack.

However, [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) sent out message to let other factions know that this was a joint military exercise with [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) and their faction is committed to their claimed goal of pursuing peace on the Zeithalt.

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0375.png)
## Eon 370 - CI gives Cybertron Jungle to PS

`‚åõ Event`

[Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) gives control over [Cybertron Jungle](../refs/cybertron_jungle.md) to [Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) upon their mutual agreement with a following public statement:

> *We are entrusting the restoration of these lands to PS after the damages from the corruption*

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0370.png)
## Eon 369 - Protectores Silva is founded

`‚åõ Event`

[Protectores Silva](../refs/protectores_silva.md) - a new faction emerges on Zeithalt Island.

Brave sellsword warriors [Mimb](../refs/mimb.md), [Ozimud](../refs/ozimud.md) and _Gabrio_, joined by CI member *Gabriel Santiago* and led by a prominent MT official [Ogrodnik](../refs/ogrodnik.md) formed a new faction.

They reached a peaceful agreement of lands gift from [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md), and established their capital in [Cerene Vale](../refs/cerene_vale.md) - their newly found homeland.

The founding statement from this new faction to the people of Zeithalt is:

> *Zeithalt is changing, under threat from unnatural disturbances and behavior. We must protect her and live in balance with nature to thrive long-term.*

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0369.png)
## Eon 368 - CI gives Imperial Swamp back to DC

`‚åõ Event`

[Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) gives back [Imperial Swamp](../refs/imperial_swamp.md) to [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) with the following message:

> *After the battle CI operatives spent the entire night combing through the swamp, removed all invasive species that had been over flourishing added some scientific research probes and now remove themselves.*

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0368.png)
## Eon 367 - The Fishy Battle of Imperial Swamp

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md)

Cybernetics Inc attacks the [Deltans](../refs/deltans.md) and wins The Fishy Battle Of [Imperial Swamp](../refs/imperial_swamp.md).

A notable achievement for Cybers - it is their first victory in a battle against factions, allowing them to repeat the MT‚Äôs record of holding 10 lands at the same time.

[MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) mostly stayed out of it, adhering to their new policy of peacekeeping, although some MT players in pursuit of gold and fame were active during the battle.

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0367.png)
## Eon 359 - The Battle of Corrupted Forest

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) (combined faction forces)

[A‚Äôas Forest](../refs/aas_forest.md) is successfully defended by the combined forces of three factions.

Honorable mention - MTs battle commander [Revalx](../refs/revalx.md), for doing impressive work in organising the people of all factions.

Other notable events include:
- Record low participation from [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md);
- MindTech Institute not using their [Garrisons](../refs/garrisons.md) nor [Corrupted Mines](../refs/cr_mines.md) to help the defence;
- it‚Äôs a _very_ close call again, the outcome of the battle decided in the very last moments.

Reports say that [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) and  were able to gather enough corrupted matter and complete (separately) their own [CR Research](../refs/cr_artefacts.md) projects.

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0359.png)
## Eon 353 - Corruption research in full swing

`‚åõ Event`

Predictions about [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) targets are no longer based on rumours and prophecies.

Due to ongoing peace, factions have set up an extensive network of control stations and research facilities all over the island.

Based on the observations done by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) scientists, it is reported that the first signs of approaching [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) are appearing in [A‚Äôas Forest](../refs/aas_forest.md).
## Eon 352 - DC calls off an attack

`‚åõ Event`

After two other factions skipped their turns in hopes to preserve peace, [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) decided to join this effort and too will not attack at this time.

## Eon 351 - CI and DC exchange lands

`‚åõ Event`

Upon mutual agreement between [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) and [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) the following exchange of territories happens:
- Control over [Synaxos Fields](../refs/synaxos_fields.md) is transferred to [Deltans](../refs/deltans.md);
- Control over [Dev Null Marsh](../refs/dev_null_marsh.md) is transferred to [Cybers](../refs/cybers.md).
  
![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0351.png)
## Eon 349 - MT support the effort for peace

`‚åõ Event`

‚è≥ The [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) passes their attack turn with the following message:

> The Institute's Minds welcome this idea of the Cybernetics brothers and answer to the call for peace in similar manner.
> 
> We wish to not participate in combat during this cycle and pass out turn as well. Instead, we use this time to help the restoration works of the damaged circuits in the Cybertron Jungle and to further improve and evolve our own lands and minds alike.
> 
> Let the island of Zeithalt enter a new era, let it prosper in peace and harmony!


## Eon 347 - CI calls for peace

`‚åõ Event`

Still working on repairs and seeing so much destruction around them from the recent corruption strike, [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) made a call for the idea of peace within the Island. 

CI have taken that first step themselves and chose not to engage in a new battle.
## Eon 345 - The Battle of Corrupted Jungle

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) (combined faction forces)

In this very close battle after several hours of fighting everyone was on edge till the very last minute. Though great cooperation the factions have once again defeated the [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) threat.

It is believed, however, that some [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) have intentionally not participated in the hope that [Cybertron Jungle](../refs/cybertron_jungle.md) would fall. It‚Äôs just a suspicion, but this idea can be poisonous for future politics on the island.

During the battle [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) members were able to gather enough corrupted matter to synthesize [Corrupted Mines](../refs/cr_mines.md) - powerful defensive weapon, first of its kind on Zeithalt.

## Eon 339 - CR Outburst is predicted to happen in Cybertron

`‚åõ Event`

he preachers across Zeithalt once again speak of the dangers [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) brings to the Island‚Ä¶ this time [Cybertron Jungle](../refs/cybertron_jungle.md) is said to be affected.
## Eon 338 - The 3rd Battle of Mt. Pickles

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md)

The [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) and MindTech Institute alliance stands strong, bringing more benefits to the mind faction. Notably, [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) was able to put up the great fight, gathering more points than the [Minds](../refs/minds.md).

During this battle your fellow historian mostly slept and been busy with stuff, so this battle bears no special name. It‚Äôs just known as The 3rd Battle of Mt. Pickles.

Two times in a row [Cybers](../refs/cybers.md) help the Minds win new lands from [Deltans](../refs/deltans.md)‚Ä¶ which brings us to the question - what‚Äôs in it for Cybernetics Inc?

With the upcoming [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) battle, we will see if the factions are able to unite under new circumstances or if the political quarrels mean more to them than the fate of the Zeithalt Island‚Ä¶

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0338.png)
## Eon 330 - The Confusing Battle of Indigo Shore

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md)

The most notable events are [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) joining forces with MindTech Institute to attack [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md) after a long period of 6 battle when DC and CI where united. 

Quite confusing for DC who were quick to call it a betrayal.

Also, in the epic meme moment [Loki](../refs/loki.md) got confused and defended in the middle of his faction‚Äôs attack. This brought massive embarrassment to him as he was also a King of the Server at the time and everyone paid attention to his actions.

All this confusion granted the battle its name - The Confusing Battle of [Indigo Shore](../refs/indigo_shore.md).

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0330.png)
## Eon 321 - The Long Battle of Dev Null Marsh

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md)

## Eon 314 - The Battle of Corrupted Desert

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) (combined faction forces)

The factions were able to put aside their quarrels and differences to fight off the greater threat. 

Defense is successful and [Timeless Desert](../refs/timeless_desert.md) stays under MindTech Institute's control.

[HexAgon](../refs/hexagon.md), MT leader at the time and the greatest warrior of this battle, finds a unique artifact - [Corrupted gemstone](../refs/cr_gemstone.md).

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0314.png)
## Eon 310 - Unknown treat appears on the Island

`‚åõ Event`

Rumors of unknown threat start spreading across Zeithalt Island.

This date marks the begging of what would become the [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) research.
## Eon 306 - The Boring Battle

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md)

[MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) attacks [Brickland Fortress](../refs/brickland_fortress.md), however the battle ends early as the Minds realise that they cannot win this battle.

All sides of the conflict just agree to cut it short it and give the victory to Delta Collective, who keep their lands.

Due to this unusual even the battle is known as The Boring Battle.

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0301.png)
## Eon 301 - DC give Synaxos Fields to CI

`‚åõ Event`

[Delta Collective](../refs/deltan_language.md) gives control over [Synaxos Fields](../refs/synaxos_fields.md) to [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) upon their mutual agreement.

## Eon 291 - Delta Collective renames several of their lands

`‚åõ Event`

The reformation of Delta Collective continues with the renaming of the following lands:

- Landatteral Swamp becomes [Imperial Swamp](../refs/imperial_swamp.md)
- Alt. Columbia Plains become [Chaotic Plains](../refs/chaotic_plains.md)
- Lumberyard Gorge becomes [Peace Death Gorge](../refs/peace_death_gorge.md)

With newfound strength, Delta Collective attacks [Mt. Pickles](../refs/mt_pickles.md) and reclaims it from [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md)'s control.

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0290.png)
## Eon 280 - Battle of Brickland Fortress

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md)

Having won all previous battles, [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) is now believed the most powerful faction on the Island. They attack [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md)'s [Brickland Fortress](../refs/brickland_fortress.md) hoping to catch DC in their weakest moment.

However, the influx of new warriors in Delta Collective and their ability to negotiate an alliance with [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) despite recent Deltan attack helps to change the tides and win the battle.

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0280.png)
## Eon 275 - Uprising in the Delta Collective

`‚åõ Event`

A bunch of people team up to seize control of the [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md).

The faction starts speaking [Deltan language](../refs/deltan_language.md) instead of the [Common language](../refs/common_language.md) spoken universally by the whole Zeithalt. 

[GreenOtter](../refs/greenotter.md) is deposed from being a leader of Delta Collective and is exiled from the faction.

## Eon 273 - Technological advancement

In the retribution for previous MT actions, the [Cybers](../refs/cybers.md) attack [Timeless Desert](../refs/timeless_desert.md) and almost win the battle.

It all comes down to the very last minutes of the battle, and could've ended either way, but in the end the [Minds](../refs/minds.md) prevail and narrowly avoid losing their sacred land. 

![Battle Map](../timeline/map/eon0266.png)
## Eon 266 - Battle of Dev Null Marsh

`‚öîÔ∏è Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md)

This battle starts as a [Deltan](../refs/deltans.md) attack on [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md)'s [Dev Null Marsh](../refs/dev_null_marsh.md). 

Unexpectedly the MindTech Institute joins the attack, which causes confusion in both Cybers ranks and the Institute itself.

During the battle Minds temporarily start helping Cybers defense, but eventually switch back to the attack and win the battle.
