## Eon 280 - Battle of Brickland Fortress

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md)

Having won all previous battles, [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) is now believed the most powerful faction on the Island. They attack [Delta Collective](../refs/delta_collective.md)'s [Brickland Fortress](../refs/brickland_fortress.md) hoping to catch DC in their weakest moment.

However, the influx of new warriors in Delta Collective and their ability to negotiate an alliance with [Cybernetics Inc](../refs/cybernetics_inc.md) despite recent Deltan attack helps to change the tides and win the battle.
