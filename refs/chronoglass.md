## Chronoglass

**ðŸ“‘ Term**

Special kind of glass that is forged from the Timeless Desert sand. Due to unique properties of the sand, Chronoglass is able to preserve snapshots of the world, frozen in time. 

The thicker glass - more sand for the light to come through, therefore further back in the past you can see. However, the thicker the glass is, the blurrier the image gets

It takes a very skillful craftsman to craft lenses which exactly 1 day, 1 week, 1 year "thick" are and clear enough to be usable. Such lenses can be combined to make more sophisticated devices such as chrono-telescopes, chrono-binoculars, etc.

People new to the chronoglass concept, can often be riddled by the question:  
*Would a mirror made of the chronoglass give you a reflection from your past self?*
