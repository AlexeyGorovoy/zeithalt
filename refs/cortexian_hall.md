## 📖 Cortexian Hall

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Neuropolis](../refs/neuropolis.md)

A complex of administrative buildings situated at the center point of the Cerebrime Peak in [Neuropolis](../refs/neuropolis.md).

Cortexian Hall servers as a permanent residence for the [Council of Minds](../refs/council_of_minds.md), as well as the greatest archive of official documents in MT lands, and a living quarters for the Masters of the Council.

It contains many ancient books and scrolls that date back to when the capital was still in the [A'as Forest](../refs/aas_forest.md).

The Great Auditorium where the Council holds their meetings is one of the biggest indoor spaces of the island.

Often regarded as "the most important building on the Island" by MT followers, Cortexian Hall is definitely one for the MindTech Institute.
