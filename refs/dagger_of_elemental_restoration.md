## 🗡️ Dagger of Elemental Restoration

`📜 Item`

A legendary weapon discovered by [Airmanon](../refs/airmanon.md) in the [mines](../refs/gold_mines).

A dagger made with some of the very same gems found in the mines, the _Dagger of Elemental Restoration_ seems to be imbued with the powers of the elements themselves. At least, that's what local legend claims. Those same legends claim that the dagger was forged long ago with the purpose of restoring the natural balance, particularly after Corruption strikes.

Airmanon has seen that the dagger has been effective in cutting down fungal growths of Corruption left behind after such Outbursts.
