## Resources (RES)

**ðŸ“‘ Term**

All lands of Zeithalt Island are rich in resources.

They're divided into 3 broad categories:
- **Science** Resources (SCI)
- **Mineral** Resources (MIN)
- **Energy** Resources (ERG)

Factions have learned to use these resources to their advantage in battles in Special Operations.

There's also a fourth category of resources - [Temporal Resources](../refs/temporal_resources.md) or (TMP), exclusively found in the [Timeless Desert](../refs/timeless_desert.md).
