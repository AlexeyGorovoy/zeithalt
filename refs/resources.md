## Resources (RES)

**ðŸ“‘ Term**

All lands of Zeithalt Island are rich in resources.

They're divided into 3 broad categories:
- **Science** Resources (SCI)
- **Mineral** Resources (MIN)
- **Energy** Resources (ERG)

Factions have learned to use these resources to their advantage in battles in Special Operations.

There's also a fourth category of resources - **Temporal** Resources (TMP) - these are found in the Timeless Desert and possess unique properties. 

For example, TMP can be transmuted into any other kind of resources and is known to be used in [Chronoglass](/chronoglass.md) production.
