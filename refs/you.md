## You

**🧙‍♂️ Character**

An engineer from Admincity who had long been lost to Corruption in Virtuara Outpost during the late Age of Darkness.

Fortunately, after over half a thousand eons of sleep, he was able to get healed and live again thanks to a collaboration of Cybernetics Inc. and the MindTech Institute in Synaxos Fields in Eon 323.
