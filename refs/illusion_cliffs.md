## Illusion Cliffs

`🖼️ Landmark`

A place so mystical you wouldn't believe it's real, Illusion Cliffs yields many beautiful beaches and wonderous caves that made it a popular tourism spot amongst people and is situated at the south-eastern part of the faction.
Home to more than a quarter of the population, it is the industrial and commercial capital of the whole MindTech Institute.

Most of the people here lives closely to the shores, and where most of the buildings, resorts, markets, and other structure for commerce of the faction is situated. Fishing and aquaculture are two of the most famous jobs people do. While the others work on market or stalls, the different resorts and production places, or entertainment and merchandise.

Many tourists here comes at day to appreciate the beautiful marble-white cliffs that is painted into a chroma of colors by the beautiful crystalline caves shimmered by the bright sunlight, or the enchanting blue shores at night when the moonlight strikes the waters and creates the illusion of a mirror world on the other side of the ocean.

But the truly, most wonderous view in the region is right by the farthest edge of the Aurora Cliffs. As the ocean gives birth to the other world, and the sunlight wakes the colors underground, a wave of australis seeps through the skies of dusk and dawn that brings down the universe to earth.
This phenomena happens every winter solstice and is when most of the tourists comes to the region.
