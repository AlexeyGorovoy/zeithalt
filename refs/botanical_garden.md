## Underground Botanical Garden

**ðŸª§ Place**

Built in Eon 509 by Protectores Silva, the garden serves as a refuge for numerous species of plants and animals coming from all over the Zeithalt.

Due to dense, ancient forests overgrowing surface of A'as, the Botanical Garden was built as an underground complex of huge grottos, illuminated mostly thanks to system composed of luminous plants and mirrors.

While not being comparable to Wildlife Preservation in Ares Gardens in terms of variety of animals, it is unbeatable when it comes to number of carefully catalogued and cultivated representatives of flora from diverse lands and biomes.
