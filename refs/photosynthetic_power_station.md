## ðŸŒ¿ Photosynthetic Power Station

**ðŸª§ Place** in A'as Forest

PPS in short, this building was one of the first construction and scientific projects completed by Protectores Silva, in Eon 457.

As the name itself suggests, the installation uses trees to transform solar energy into chemical, and then, thanks to technology specially developed as part of this project, into electricity.

The project involves trees from over 150.000 hectares of A'an forests and supplies whole Protectores Silva with ecological, renewable energy.
