## ðŸŽ¡ The Particle Collitionist

**ðŸª§ Place** in Timeless Desert

The Particle Collider Of Little Light Items To Include Occupation Nonsense In Sands of Time (Particle COLLITIONIST) is the island's largest and only high-energy particle collider.

It was built by the Arcology Building for Operators of Desert Experiments (ABODE)  under supervision of MindTech Institute and with the help of other factions. Construction took place between E454 and E463.

It lies in a tunnel 34 kilometres (which in miles is 21) in circumference and as deep as 150 metres (which in inches is a different number) beneath the Timeless-Pickles border.
