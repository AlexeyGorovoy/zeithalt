## Corruption Restoration Project

`📑 Term`

A project initially developed to recover [Synaxos Fields](../refs/synaxos_fields.md) from [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) surge that happened in [Eon 508](../timeline/eon0508.md).

Since then, it has been reviewed and adapted to be used in other areas of the Island affected by _Corruption_.
