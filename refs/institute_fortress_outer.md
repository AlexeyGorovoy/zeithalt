## MindTech Institute Fortress (outer walls)

`ðŸª§ Place`

Building located in the heart of Neuropolis, consists of two structures: an external perimeter in which the walls made up of 50 meter high obsidian blocks are interspersed with eight towers.

The two eastern walls overlook the sea: they were built on the rocks of the Gulf of Neuropolis and are perpetually hit by the violent waves of the sea.

On the sea side there are three towers: the *Seagull Tower* to the south-east, the *Medusa Tower* to the north-east and, in the center of the eastern side, the *Shark Tower*.

Two other walls, those on the innermost side, were built on the crest of *Mount Delirium* (an extinct volcano): on the top stands the western tower, *Eagle Tower*.

Inside the perimeter walls are located the stables, the garage, the structures reserved for the soldiers (the dormitories, the hospital, the canteen, the training rooms, the leisure areas).

Each perimeter tower contains officers' quarters, transmission rooms and observation points. Towers and walls are heavily armed.

Inside the perimeter there is the *Forest of Bitter Regrets*, where mainly willows grow, and the *Lake of Doubts*, surrounded by a perpetual fog due to the underground thermal springs that feed it.

Trees and fog hide the view of the structure built in the center of the perimeter, the actual Fortress.
