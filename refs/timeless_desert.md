## Timeless Desert

**üñºÔ∏è Landmark**

A vast ocean filled with nothing but sand, for miles and miles, without anything in sight other than the arid wastes of the desert itself.

Mysterious sands of Timeless Desert are known to affect travellers' perception of time.

There are cases of people wandering the desert for months only to find they there were missing for a few hours, and what was perceived as a short hike sometimes lasted eons for people outside of the desert.
