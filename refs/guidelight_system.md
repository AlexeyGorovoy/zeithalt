## üî¶ Guidelight System

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark` in [Oblivion Mire](../refs/oblivion_mire.md)

Completed on eon 805 by [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md), this system provides guidance to travelers through the treacherous swamps of _Oblivion Mire_.

The system consists of lights set up in such a way that a traveler only ever sees the next guiding light on their path, and walking directly towards it allows for a safe passage.

The Guidelight System consists of two main routes:
- The Primary Path goes from west to east, connecting [Timeless Desert](../refs/timeless_desert.md) to [A'as Forest](../refs/aas_forest.md), with a separate branch going towards Paradox Pass, connecting directly to [Axonite Road](../refs/axonite_road.md).
- The Secondary Path going from north to south, connecting [Blue Screen Lagoon](../refs/blue_screen_lagoon.md) to [Cerene Vale](../refs/cerene_vale.md).

These paths mostly go along the same routes Mire's inhabitants use for ceonturies. However, the Guidelight System provides a reliable and relatively safe way to navigate these routes much quicker and without the need to employ local villagers as guides.
