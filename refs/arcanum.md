## The Arcanum

`ðŸ“‘ Term`

**The Arcanum**, also known as "The Secret Book" and "The Book of Secrets" is rumored to be the most important book in [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md)'s teachings.

It is associated first and foremost with the [Masters of the Council](../refs/council_of_minds.md).

The common understanding is that each of the Masters has their own unique version of the book. This is indirectly proven by the lectures given in the Institute: even when Masters speak of the same topics, theirs readings of the book are vastly different.

The Arcanum cannot be read by anyone but the Masters of the Council, and the exact contents of it remain a closely guarded secret.

This paves the way for many conspiracy theories ranging from relatively modest - Masters starting to write their own version of the Arcanum when accepted into the Council; and to the obscure ones as the book being *[Timeless](../refs/timeless_desert.md)* with each of the Masters reading literally different versions of it.

However, the most prevalent theory is actually a running joke that the book is in fact empty, and Masters are making up their lectures on the spot.
