## Corrupted Artefacts

**ðŸ“œ Item**

During Corruption outbursts, sometimes samples of the corrupted matter itself can be found and carefully collected.

These samples are known as CR Samples, and factions use them to develop Corrupted Artefacts. 

There are three two types of Corrupted Artefacts: CR Mines and CR Shards.
