### Bank of Zeithalt

Bank of Zeithalt (BoZ) is the governing entity of the whole ***Zeithalt Island***; it manages and overlooks the entire island's economy system. 

Bank of Zeithalt stays out of faction politics and largely remains in shadows, keeping the islands economy working and successfully evading being influence by any faction.

Itâ€™s assumed to be by far the richest organisation on the island, being the owner of multiple Gold Mines in different parts of the Island.
