## Valkyrie Spec Ops

`ðŸ“‘ Term`

Valkyrie Special Operations Squad is an independent mercenary service, led by a mysterious strategic leadership. The tactical field operations are supervised by [Revalx](../refs/revalx.md), who manages the members of the Valkyries.

Initially, there were no proper pricing scheme, only running on opinion-based discourse to determine their alignment in battles. When Revalx co-founded the [Fighters Guild](../refs/fighters_guild.md) alongside other  prominent sellswords, the service now accepts formal paid contracts as provided by the Guild.
