## MindTech Symbology

`ðŸ“‘ Term`

Officially adopted on eon 768 by the [Council of Minds](../refs/council_of_minds.md), these symbols are derived from the ancient [MindTech](../refs/mindtech_institute.md) symbols used in the times of the [First Capital](../refs/first_capital.md).

The triquetra is adopted as the main symbol of the faction, used as both - a standalone symbol on stamps, coats of arms and banners, as well as part of both peace and war MT flags.

The following meanings are assigned to these symbols:

**The triquetra** symbolizes the tree main towers of the [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md).

**The surrounding circle** is the symbol of control the _MindTech_ has of [the three towers](../refs/institute_fortress_inner.md), also a reference to the mystic 4th tower.

**The triangle** further emphasises the unity of the three towers, as well as the movement forward and forms the letter "M" with the white side-bands when the flag is used as a vertical banner

**The orange color** is the official color of our faction, originally derived from the **sands of the [Timeless Desert](../refs/timeless_desert.md)** - sacred MT land.

**The deep red** used exclusively on war flags and banners is the symbol of bravery of MT warriors, as well as the color of the blood they shed for MT, and a reference to [Corruption](../refs/corruption.md) that arose from MT lands and hits them most often.
