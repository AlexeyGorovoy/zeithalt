## Age of Conquest

**ðŸ“… Time period**

The age during which factions formed and grew powerful enough to start conquering nearby free lands.

Some sort of a non-aggression pact existed between factions during the Age of Conquest - they only attacked free lands together and never attacked each other.

The Age of Conquest started at Eon 0 and ended at Eon 253 with the ***Battle of Timeless Desert*** when the last free territory fell and factions could no longer expand without directly attacking each otherâ€™s lands.
