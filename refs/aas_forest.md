## Aas Forest

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark`

Named after one of the old kings of the Mindtech Institute, A'as Forest is a lush and bountiful woods at the south of the faction that is considered as an ancient and the oldest place in the faction.

It is also where the previous capital of the MindTech Institute used to be.

Most of the people who live here presides near the borders or the eastern and southern parts of the region.

Although with little population, with the previous capital being here, it has many ancient and forgotten structures that lie around, with most of it being in the north-western part of the forest. The mystery around the forest stands there, where not in a mile radius can you see signs of fauna. Even people who pass here feels a chill in their spines, as if the forest is telling them to not set foot in those lands. Although shown in most books, no one but those at the Cortexian Hall holds the old books and ancient scrolls that might answer the mystery of to what may have happened there.

In the said population, most of them work as lumberjacks and craftsmen, supplying wood, wooden supplies, and even furniture to the rest of the faction. Some others work as farmers that tend the orchard trees around the forest, which produces many fruits that is either shipped as it is, pickled, made into jams, or other fruit-preserving methods.
