## Council of Minds

`ðŸ“‘ Term`

A governing body of [MindTech Institute](../refs/mindtech_institute.md), consisting of recognized citizens, skilled warriors and prominent scholars of the faction.

The Council is as old as the faction itself, and its history ranges from the ultimate power on the island during the times it was led by [hexAgon](../refs/hexagon.md) to the complete dissolution during the times of [Loki](../refs/loki.md)'s dictatorship.

The Council was restored on [Eon 755](../timeline/eon0755.md) following the fall of the ruthless dictator.
